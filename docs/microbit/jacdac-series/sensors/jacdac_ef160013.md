# Jacdac magnet Sensor

It uses the Hall effect to detect magnetic field changes and convert the magnetic field strength into electrical signals. It is often used in motor speed detection, inferring the speed by sensing the magnetic field changes of the rotor; in applications such as electronic compasses, it accurately determines the direction to guide navigation and positioning devices.
