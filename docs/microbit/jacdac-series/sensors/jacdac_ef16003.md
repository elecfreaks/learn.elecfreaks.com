# Jacdac Rotray Encoder

This module provides precise rotation feedback. Through rotation operations, it can generate different encoding signals to accurately reflect the rotation direction and number of steps. It is often used in parameter adjustment scenarios, such as volume control and menu selection, allowing users to make fine settings during rotation.
