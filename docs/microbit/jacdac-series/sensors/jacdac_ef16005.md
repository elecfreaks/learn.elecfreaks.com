# Jacdac Light Sensor

This module is extremely sensitive to changes in light and can output corresponding signals according to the ambient light intensity. In intelligent lighting systems, it automatically distinguishes between light and dark to achieve automatic light on/off or brightness adjustment; in outdoor equipment, it can also adjust the screen display brightness according to the light, saving energy and protecting eyes.
