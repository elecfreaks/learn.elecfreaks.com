# Robot PU Think

## Lesson: Robot Thinking (Feedback Loops)

"Robot thinking" is usually not human-like thinking. In robotics, it often means:

- observe sensors
- compute an adjustment
- apply the adjustment
- repeat fast

This is called a **feedback loop** (closed-loop control).

In Robot PU, walking and balancing is a great example. The extension's `moveBalance(...)` continuously reads the IMU and adjusts servo targets while walking.



## 1. Control loops: open-loop vs closed-loop

### A. Open-loop control (no feedback)

Open-loop means:

- you command an action
- you do **not** measure the result
- you assume the robot behaves as expected

**Example idea:**

- "Set leg servos to these angles and hope the robot is stable."

**Pros:**

- simple
- predictable on perfect hardware

**Cons:**

- sensitive to battery voltage, friction, payload, bumps
- cannot recover when the real world differs from your assumption



### B. Closed-loop control (feedback)

**Closed-loop means:**

- command an action
- measure what happened (sensors)
- compute an error
- correct the command

**Pros:**

- robust to disturbance
- self-correcting

**Cons:**

- more complex
- needs good sensor data and good tuning



## 2. Robot PU example: `moveBalance()` (walking + balance)

In `robotpu.ts`, walking calls:

- `walk(sp, di)` → `moveBalance(sp, di, ...)`


High-level idea inside `moveBalance(...)`:

1. **Observation:** read IMU data and estimate body tilt
2. **Thinking:** compute how much to tilt/offset the legs and body to stay balanced
3. **Action:** apply those offsets as "control vectors" to the servo targets

Then it calls the lower-level gait engine (`wk.move(...)`) to advance the motion state.



## 3. Observation: `balanceParam()` (sensor → state estimate)

`balanceParam()` reads the accelerometer:


- `input.acceleration(Dimension.X/Y/Z)`


And computes tilt-related internal signals (examples you'll see in the code):

- `bodyRoll`, `bodyPitch`
- filtered versions `bodyRoll2`, `bodyPitch2` (smoothed over time)

This is a small but important idea: **filtering**.

- raw sensors are noisy
- filtering reduces noise so control outputs don’t jitter



## 4. Thinking: turn IMU tilt into corrective offsets

In `moveBalance(...)`, the robot uses the estimated roll/pitch to compute offsets:

- if the robot leans left → shift weight / servo offsets to recover
- if the robot leans right → do the opposite

You'll see logic like:

- **clamp** the correction (`maxRollCtrl`) so it cannot over-correct
- **slow down** when tilt is large (safety + stability)

The output of "thinking" is a set of **control signals** written into `pr.servoCtrl[...]`.

That control vector is then combined with the current gait pose targets.



## 5. Action: apply control and step the gait

The action step is:

- apply the computed `servoCtrl` offsets
- call `wk.move(...)` to take one small step toward the current pose

That's why motion actions are designed to be called repeatedly: each call is one iteration of the feedback + motion update.



## 6. Types of controllers (concepts)

Robot PU's balancing logic is a practical example of a **heuristic controller** (hand-designed rules + clamping + smoothing).

Other common controllers:


- **P controller**: correction proportional to error
- **PD controller**: proportional + damping (uses error change rate)
- **PID controller**: proportional + integral + derivative

Typical tradeoffs:

- **P:** simple, but may oscillate
- **PD:** more stable, less overshoot
- **PID:** can remove steady-state error, but can be tricky to tune



## 7. More advanced "thinking" (not required, but good to know)

These are common in more advanced robots. They are mentioned here as future directions *(they are not implemented in this tutorial code)*.


**Kalman filter / complementary filter**

- Better sensor fusion (e.g., accel + gyro) and better state estimation

**Feed-forward control**

- Predict required servo output from the planned motion

- combine with feedback for best results

**Probabilistic models (Bayesian / probability networks)**

- Represent uncertainty explicitly (useful when sensors are noisy)

**Reinforcement learning**

- Q-learning / Q-tables: learn which action to take in each state

- modern variants use neural networks (Deep Q Networks)

## 8. Practical MakeCode pattern: Observation → Thinking → Action

Here is the general pattern you'll reuse in many projects:

```typescript
basic.forever(function () {
    // Observation
    const cm = robotPu.sonarDistanceCm()

    // Thinking
    let speed = 2
    let turn = 0
    if (cm > 0 && cm < 15) {
        speed = -2
        turn = 0.8
    }

    // Action
    robotPu.walk(speed, turn)
})
```

The difference between a "dumb" robot and a "smart" robot is usually the quality of the **Thinking** step.
