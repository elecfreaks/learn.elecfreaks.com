    title="The Pull Ups"
    description="Pull-ups are exercises where you use your own strength to pull your body up to a bar and then lower it back down, repeating it several times. It is a great exercise for the body and can make our back, shoulders and arms stronger. Pull-up exercises also make our bodies more upright and toned. In this lesson we will use the Nezha Inventor's Kit V2 to create a robot that can do pull-ups."

    title="The Swimming Robot"
    description="Swimming is a sport and skill in which you float in the water by your own power and move forward through the water with the movement of your own limbs. Competitive swimming is the second largest sport in the Olympic Games and includes: butterfly, backstroke (also known as backstroke), breaststroke, jibe (also known as freestyle), four strokes of racing, and synchronised swimming. There are many benefits to swimming, such as toning, cardiorespiratory fitness, relaxation and improved confidence. Swimming is also a low-impact exercise that can reduce joint and bone damage. In this lesson we will use the Nezha Inventor's Kit V2 to create a robot that simulates the sport of swimming."

    title="The Weight Lifting Robot"
    description="Weightlifting involves lifting a barbell with two discs above your head with both hands and seeing who can lift the heaviest barbell. It sounds easy, but it is actually very difficult because weightlifting requires not only great strength, but also great skill, a very steady balance and a high level of coordination. Furthermore, weightlifting also requires a very strong psychological profile and willpower, as there is a lot of pressure and challenges to face when lifting weights.Lifting weights can make us physically stronger, more flexible and healthier, and it can also make our self-confidence and self-esteem higher.Today we will use the Nezha Inventor's Kit V2 to create a robot that can simulate weightlifting movements."

    href="./the-unicycle-robot/"
    title="The Unicycle Robot"
    description="Unicycle tightrope walking is an extremely challenging and exciting performance art. It combines balance, co-ordination and skill, allowing people to watch in awe as the performers demonstrate extraordinary balance and precise control in a highly stressful environment.In this performance, the performer rides a unicycle (a special vehicle with only one wheel) across a high suspended wire. This wire is usually suspended between two supports and the height and distance needs to be precisely measured and adjusted to ensure the performer's safety.The performers need to maintain their balance during the performance and use subtle body adjustments to keep the unicycle stable on the wire. They need to be highly focused and ready to respond to challenges posed by external factors such as wind, vibrations or small changes in their own posture. Even the slightest imbalance can cause a performer to fall or lose their balance.We're building a unicycle robot today with the Nezha Inventor's Kit V2."

There are many different forms of dance, including contemporary, ballet, jazz and street dance. Whether it is a professional performance on stage or a free dance at a large family gathering, dancing can evoke passion and joy within people. It is not only a form of physical expression, but also a form of cultural transmission and communication. Dancing is a way to build physical fitness and improve co-ordination, and it also gives people the opportunity to relax and release stress. Whether you are a dancer or an audience member, dancing is a wonderful artistic feast that allows people to enjoy the beauty and joy that dance brings.This course aims to introduce students to the principles of motor control, the use of gearing and the effect of the centre of gravity on balance through the creation of a dancing robot with the Nezha Inventor's Kit V2. Students will have hands-on experience building a dancing robot and learn how to use gearing and control motors to achieve the robot's dancing movements.

    title="The Crawling Robot"
    description="Crawling is a common form of locomotion in the animal world. We can observe that many animals such as snakes, spiders and geckos have a unique way of crawling. They move forward through coordinated body movements, contraction and extension of their muscles and friction with the ground. The way these animals crawl has a certain regularity, but also shows their individual characteristics and flexibility.The aim of this course is to introduce students to the principles of motor control and the application of gearing by creating an example of a crawling robot. Students will use the materials in Nezha Inventor's Kit V2 to build a crawling robot and learn how to achieve the crawling action of the robot by controlling the motors and gearing.

    title="The Walking Robot"
    description="Walking is one of the most basic and common forms of locomotion in the animal world. We can observe that many animals such as humans, cats and dogs have their own unique way of walking. They achieve a stable walking movement by moving their limbs in a coordinated manner and adjusting their body balance. Different animals have different gait and posture, showing their own characteristics and flexibility.In this project, we will try to imitate the walking movements of animals by designing and building a robot that can simulate their steps. Using the materials in Nezha Inventor's Kit V2, we will build the structure of the robot and control its movement with a motor. At the same time, we will learn and apply the principles of gearing to achieve coordinated movements and walking motions of the robot."

    title="The Scorpion Robot"
    description="Scorpions are striking arthropods that belong to a family of arachnids. They live in all corners of the earth, including desert, forest and grassland environments. Scorpions usually have a long body and a pair of curved tails, often with a venomous stinger at the end. Their physical appearance shows a variety of colours and patterns, ranging from light yellow to dark brown or black.Scorpions feed on insects, arachnids and other small invertebrates. They have a well-developed sensory system, especially their antennae and eyes, which help them locate and capture prey in the dark. The scorpion's venomous stinger contains toxins and is generally used for defence and to capture food.We'll be making a scorpion today with the Nezha Inventor's Kit V2."

    title="The Mechanical Crawler"
    description="Caterpillars are small insect larvae which usually have soft and hairy bodies. Caterpillars are the larval stage of insects such as butterflies and moths, in which they prepare to become adults by feeding and growing. The caterpillar's body consists of a number of segments, each with a pair of legs through which they crawl.Caterpillars crawl by wriggling through their bodies. Their legs move alternately, thus propelling the body forward. This way of crawling allows the caterpillar to crawl freely on a variety of surfaces such as leaves, branches and the ground.We will use the Nezha Inventor's Kit V2 to create a mechanical crawler that mimics the way a caterpillar moves."
