## Teaching Objectives

- Learn about the basic principles and applications of egg beaters.
- Learn how to use the Nezha Inventor's Kit V2 to create an automatically rotating whisk.
- Design and build suitable mechanical structures to support the movement of the egg beater.
- Develop teamwork, problem solving and creative thinking skills.

## Teaching Preparations

## Teaching Process

### Introduce

>Introduce students to the background and objectives of egg beater making to stimulate their interest and curiosity.

You must all have seen a whisk before! It is a tool used to mix ingredients and is especially useful when making cakes, pastry and other foods. Do you know how a whisk works? In today's lesson, we will explore the principle of a whisk together and make a whisk that rotates automatically using the Nezha Inventor's Kit V2.

### Exploration

> Discuss in groups and ask students to think about how to make a whisk out of the building block materials.

- How does the whisk make the egg mixture fluffy and even?
- By what means do you think the whisk is rotated?

### Practice

> Work in groups to create an egg beater from building blocks according to your own design.

Build an egg beater from blocks according to your own design.
