## Teaching Process

### Introduce

>Students are introduced to the background and objectives of motorbike building to stimulate their interest and curiosity.

A motorbike is a unique and swift means of transportation that transmits power from the engine to the wheels through gearing to achieve forward motion. In this lesson, we will learn about gear transmission and build a simple motorbike model by using the Nezha Inventor's Kit V2. We will explore the principles and applications of gearing and learn how it works in a motorbike.

Through the process of building a motorbike, we will learn how to design and build a suitable gearing mechanism for the forward and turning functions of a motorbike. We will understand how different gears fit together and explore how gearing works.

### Exploration

>Discuss in groups and get students thinking about how they can make a motorbike from block materials.

- What is gearing? What is its role in a motorbike?
- How to build a simple model of a motorbike using Nezha Inventor's Kit V2?
- How to design and build a suitable gear train for the forward and turning functions of a motorbike?
- How can the parameters of the gear train be adjusted to change the speed and steering effect of the motorbike?
- Do you have any other creative or improvement ideas that would make the motorbike more interesting or functional?

### Practice

>Work in groups to create a motorbike from block materials according to your own design.

Build a motorbike from building blocks according to your own design.
