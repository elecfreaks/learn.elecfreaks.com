# Case 02: Flower-watering Prompter

## Introduction

Some plants can make people live healthier. For example, a pot of green dill in a room of 8-10 square meters is equivalent to an air purifier, which can effectively absorb harmful gases such as formaldehyde, benzene and trichloroethylene in the air. Thus, we can make a simple watering device to help us take care of plants.

## Quick Start

### Materials Required

Nezha expansion board × 1

micro:bit × 1

LED-red × 1

LED-green × 1

Soil moisture sensor × 1

RJ11 wires × 3

***Tips: You may need to purchase [Nezha Inventor's Kit](https://www.elecfreaks.com/nezha-inventor-s-kit-for-micro-bit-without-micro-bit-board.html) if you want all the above compoents.***



### Connection Diagram

Connect the green LED to J4, red LED to J3 and soil moisture sensor to J2 on the Nezha expansion board as the picture shows.

## MakeCode Programming



### Step 1
Click "Advanced" in the MakeCode to see more choices.

For programming, we need to add a package: click "Extensions" at the bottom of the MakeCode drawer and search with "PlanetX" in the dialogue box to download it.

***Notice:*** If you met a tip indicating that some codebases would be deleted due to incompatibility, you may continue as the tips say or create a new project in the menu.

### Step 2

### Code as below:

You may also download it directly below:

<div
    style={{
        position: 'relative',
        paddingBottom: '60%',
        overflow: 'hidden',
    }}
>
    <iframe
        src="https://makecode.microbit.org/_gmtM095oj1cd"
        frameborder="0"
        sandbox="allow-popups allow-forms allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
        style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
        }}
    />
</div>


### Result
The red LED lights on for reminding of watering if the soil moisture sensors gets a low value from the earth, or the green LED lights on.
