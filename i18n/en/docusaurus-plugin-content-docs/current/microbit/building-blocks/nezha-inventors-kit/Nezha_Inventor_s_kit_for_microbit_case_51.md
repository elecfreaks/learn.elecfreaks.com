# Case 51: Lifting Dry Rack

## Introduction

When we do our daily chores, washing clothes should be considered a task that we often have to do, especially after washing clothes in the washing machine, drying clothes on top of a high drying rack is particularly laborious. Well, in order to solve this trouble, we do a lifting drying rack here, which not only can help us save physical strength, but also give us the experience of the way that is getting changed from the technology.

## Connection Diagram

Connect the two motors to the M1 and M4 , and the ultrasonic sensor to the J1, as the diagram suggests.

##  MakeCode Programming

### Step 1

Click “Advanced” in the MakeCode drawer to see more choices.

For programming the servo, we need to add a package. Click “Extensions” at the bottom of the drawer and search with “nezha” to download it.

For programming the PIR sensor, we need to add a package. Search with “PlanetX” in the dialogue box and click to download it.

            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
        }}
    />
</div>

### Result

When we want to dry the clothes, press the A button, the drying rack will drop, and when the clothes rack is placed on the drying rod, the drying rack will automatically rise.
