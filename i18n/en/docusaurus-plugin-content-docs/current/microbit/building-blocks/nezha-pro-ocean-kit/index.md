# Nezha Pro Ocean Kit

The Nezha Pro ocean-themed kit, with programming building blocks as the carrier and Ian's ocean adventure story as the main line, helps students explore marine ecology and biodiversity. The courses cover the survival skills of marine organisms, as well as examples of human development and utilization of the ocean such as tidal power generation and marine aquaculture. Students will conduct in-depth research on the challenges faced in marine resource development, understand the impact of human activities on marine ecology, and attempt to propose solutions to these issues. The kit aims to enhance students' understanding of the ocean, stimulate their interest in exploration, and foster a sense of marine conservation.
