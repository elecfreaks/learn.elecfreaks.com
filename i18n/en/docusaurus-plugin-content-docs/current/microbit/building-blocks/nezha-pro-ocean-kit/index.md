# Nezha Pro Ocean Kit

The Nezha Pro Ocean Theme Kit uses programming blocks as a carrier and Xiao En's ocean adventure story as the main line to help students explore marine ecology and biodiversity. The course covers marine life survival skills, as well as examples of human development and utilization of the ocean, such as tidal power generation and marine aquaculture. Students will explore the challenges faced by the development of marine resources, understand the impact of human activities on marine ecology, and try to propose solutions to these problems. The kit aims to enhance students' marine cognition, stimulate their interest in exploration, and cultivate awareness of marine protection.
