# Nezha Pro Ocean Kit

---
## Product Introduction

The Nezha Pro Ocean Kit uses electronic components + building blocks as the carrier, with Ian's ocean adventure as the main line, closely focusing on marine knowledge. Through a project-based learning approach, students can learn about marine ecology and biodiversity, understand the unique survival skills of marine organisms, as well as human development and utilization of the ocean, such as tidal power generation and marine aquaculture. It explores the challenges in marine resource development and tries to propose solutions. At the same time, in the face of problems caused by human activities to the marine ecology and environment, students learn how to respond and try to give solutions. This course aims to improve students' understanding of the ocean, stimulate their interest in ocean exploration, and plant a seed of yearning for the ocean in their hearts.
