# Nezha Pro Ocean Suit

---
## Product Introduction

Nezha Pro Ocean Set uses electronic components + building blocks as the carrier, takes Xiao En's ocean adventure as the main line, and closely revolves around ocean knowledge. Through a project-based learning method, students learn about marine ecology and biodiversity, understand the unique survival skills of marine organisms, and human development and utilization of the ocean, such as tidal power generation, marine aquaculture, etc. Explore the challenges in the development of marine resources and try to propose solutions. At the same time, in the face of problems brought by human activities to the marine ecology and environment, learn how to deal with them and try to provide solutions. This course aims to improve students' understanding of the ocean, stimulate their interest in ocean exploration, and plant a seed of yearning for the ocean in students' hearts.
