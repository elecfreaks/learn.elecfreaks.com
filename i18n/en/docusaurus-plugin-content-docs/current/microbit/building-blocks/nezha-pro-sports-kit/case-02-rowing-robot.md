## Teaching Objectives

Understand the characteristics of worm gears.
Cultivate hands-on skills and problem-solving skills.
Stimulate interest in engineering and robotics.

## Course Introduction

Welcome children to join our wonderful STEAM journey! Today, we will explore how to make a rowing robot without programming. The core of this project is to use the clever application of worm gear structure. In this project, we will learn basic mechanical design principles and understand how to control the movement of the robot through simple mechanical transmission. You can create a rowing robot without complex programming knowledge, just assembly and adjustment. Let's start this exciting STEAM learning journey together to stimulate your creativity and problem-solving skills!

## Summary and sharing

## Extended knowledge

** Working principle of worm gear **

The working principle of worm gear involves two main components: worm and worm wheel. Here is a detailed explanation of how they interact and achieve motion conversion:

Worm (Screw):

A worm is a rod with a spiral shape and continuous threads on its surface, similar to a screw.

The threads of a worm can be single-start (one spiral) or multi-start (multiple spirals).

Worm Gear:

A worm wheel is a gear whose tooth shape matches the threads of the worm, usually with more teeth to increase the contact area and improve transmission efficiency.

The teeth of the worm wheel are usually designed to be tangent to the helix of the worm to ensure smooth meshing.

Meshing process:

When the worm rotates, its threads push the teeth of the worm wheel, causing the worm wheel to rotate around its axis.

Since the teeth of the worm wheel precisely mesh with the threads of the worm, the rotational motion of the worm is converted into the rotational motion of the worm wheel.
Motion conversion:

A worm gear mechanism can convert the rotational motion of the worm into the rotational motion of the worm wheel.
This conversion is usually accompanied by a reduction in speed and an increase in torque, because the number of teeth of the worm wheel is greater than the number of starts of the worm, thus achieving **speed reduction** and **torque increase**.
Self-locking property:

A notable feature of the worm gear mechanism is **self-locking**, that is, the worm wheel cannot reverse drive the worm without external power.
This feature is due to the friction between the worm and the worm wheel and the tooth design, which allows the worm wheel to be locked in place by the worm.
Efficiency and application:

The efficiency of the worm gear mechanism is affected by many factors, including the accuracy of the tooth shape, the choice of materials and the lubrication conditions.
Due to its self-locking characteristics and ability to provide high torque, the worm gear mechanism is often used in applications that require precise control and large reduction ratios, such as elevators, conveying systems and robot joints.
