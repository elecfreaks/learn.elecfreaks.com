## Teaching Objectives

Understand the characteristics and construction methods of gear transmission
Inspire interest in engineering and robotics.

## Course Introduction

Welcome children to join our wonderful STEAM journey! Today, we will explore how to make a rope skipping robot without programming. The core of this project is to use the clever application of gear transmission structure. In this project, we will learn basic mechanical design principles and understand how to control the movement of the robot through simple mechanical transmission. You can create a rope skipping robot without complex programming knowledge, just assembly and adjustment. Let's start this exciting STEAM learning journey together to stimulate your creativity and problem-solving ability!

## Summary and sharing

## Extended knowledge

**Relationship between transmission ratio and speed**

Transmission ratio formula: number of teeth on the driving wheel: number of teeth on the driven wheel. For example, when a 24-tooth gear drives an 8-tooth gear, the speed of the driven wheel is 3 times that of the driving wheel.

**Power and torque conversion**

When a small gear drives a large gear, the speed decreases but the torque increases (applicable to scenarios that require greater power)
When a large gear drives a small gear, the speed increases but the torque decreases (applicable to scenarios that require faster speed)
