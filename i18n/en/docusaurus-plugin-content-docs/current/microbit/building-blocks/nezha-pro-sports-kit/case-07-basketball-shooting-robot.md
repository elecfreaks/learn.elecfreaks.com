## Summary and sharing



## Extended knowledge

**What are the functions of micro:bit? **

micro:bit is a microcomputer development board designed for programming education for teenagers. It has many functions. The following is an introduction to its main functions:

***Input function***

Button input: There are two programmable buttons A and B on the front of micro:bit, which can be used alone or in combination to trigger various events, such as start, pause, select and other operations.

Touch input: The gold logo of the v2 version of micro:bit can be used as a touch sensor, which is equivalent to an additional button, adding a new input method to the program.

Sensor input: Including light sensor, temperature sensor, acceleration sensor and compass sensor, which can detect information such as ambient light intensity, ambient temperature, acceleration and movement status of the device, direction of the earth's magnetic field, etc.

***Output function***

LED display: There are 25 independently programmable LED lights arranged in a 5×5 grid, which can display text, numbers, images and animations, etc., for displaying information or interacting with users.

Sound output: The v2 version is equipped with a speaker that can play sounds and melodies. It can be used to make music, sound effects and other projects, which increases the fun of the project.

***Communication function***

Radio communication: Supports radio communication, which can transmit wireless data between multiple micro:bit boards, and is used to create multiplayer games, interactive projects, etc.

Bluetooth low energy: Through the Bluetooth low energy antenna, micro:bit can communicate wirelessly with computers, mobile phones, tablets and other devices to achieve connection and control between devices.

***Extended function***

Pin interface: There are 25 external interface pins on the edge of the micro:bit connector. Through these pins, various external electronic components such as motors, LED lights, sensors, etc. can be connected to expand its functions.

USB interface: Used to connect to a computer to download, upload and debug programs, and also provide power for micro:bit.
