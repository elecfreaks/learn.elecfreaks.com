## Introduction


Based on the Ring:bit V2 from Elecfreaks, the micro:bit Ring:bit Bricks Pack contains 360 degrees servos, the LED strips and almost 200 pieces bricks. Together with the well-designed assembly instructions and courses, it makes the kids learn the coding easily as well as how to build blocks in an interesting way.
