# Remote Control with micro:bit Accelerometer

## Purpose
---
- Programme to control the TPBot with the accelerometer.

## Material
---

- 1 x [TPBot](https://item.taobao.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.5-c-s.w4002-18602834185.41.68d15ccfBFHNPy&id=618758535761)

### Sample

### Remote Control Part

- Set the micro:bit showing a set icon and the radio group as 1.
- Radio send x which is given by its acceleration dividing 10 in the forever brick.
- Radio send y which is given by its acceleration dividing 10  in the forever brick.

        }}
    />
</div>

### Receiving Part

- Set the micro:bit showing a set icon and the radio group as 1.
- Drag two" if...else..." sentences to the "on radio received..." block, judge if the received name is x or y.
- If it's x, save it as the variable as the accelaration from the x.
- If it's y, save it as the variable as the accelaration from the y.
- Set the speed of the left wheel being y+x and the right wheel being y-x.

</div>

### Conclusion

- Power up to show the set icon on the micro:bit display, and the movement of TPBot is controlled by the changing angel from the micro:bit.
