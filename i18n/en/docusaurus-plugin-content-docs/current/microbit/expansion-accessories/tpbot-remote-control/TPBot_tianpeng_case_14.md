### Sample

### Remote Control Part

- Set the radio group as 1.
- Judge the value of x&y of the Joystick in the forever brick, if the value of the x is below 200, radio send number 4;  if the value of the x is over 800, radio send number 3; if the value of the y is below 200, radio send number 2; if the value of the y over 800, radio send number 1; or radio send number 0.

### Receiving Part

- Set the radio group as 1.
- Save the received number as the variable in "on radio received..."block.
- Judge if the value is 1, if yes, set the TPBot moving forward at the speed of 100%; if it's 2, set the TPBot reversing at the speed of 50%; if it's 3, set the TPBot turning left at the speed of 50%;  if it's 4, set the TPBot turning right at the speed of 50%; If it's 0, set the TPBot to stop.
