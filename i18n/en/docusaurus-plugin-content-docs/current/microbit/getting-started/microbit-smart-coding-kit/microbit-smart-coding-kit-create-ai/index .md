# Create AI 

## Project Background

With the increasing application of AI in daily life, popularizing AI education has become particularly important. We can combine basic AI knowledge such as big data, neural networks, machine learning, and image recognition, and rely on micro:bit products and ecosystems to help students understand the basic principles of AI, master AI knowledge and basic applications, stimulate children's interest in AI, and plant the seeds of AI in their hearts.

## What is Create AI

micro:bit CreateAI is a free, web-based tool that enables students to easily collect motion data using the micro:bit's accelerometer and train machine learning (ML) models to recognize patterns in the data. By writing micro:bit code to run these ML models, students can complete various interesting and educational project cases.
