## Flip a coin ##

## Introduction

In soccer, the referee usually decides which team will kick off first by tossing a coin. Before the match begins, the referee calls the captains of the two teams and then makes a coin toss, where the team that wins the toss gets to choose whether they want to kick off first or choose the field. If they choose to tee off first, then the opposing team chooses the field; and vice versa. This method of tossing a coin is fair and ensures that the game is fair.

## Teaching Objectives

Understand the basic rules of a soccer game.

To make a case for coin tossing through micro:bit.

To develop problem solving skills.

## Teaching Preparation

Before you start teaching, please make sure you have prepared the following necessary materials:

These materials will provide you with a complete experience and ensure that you can follow through and learn smoothly. If you are ready for the above, we can move on to the next step.


## Programming

### Programming Platforms

We usually use [graphical programming platform makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/) to program micro:bit

Programming platform entry: [https://makecode.microbit.org/](https://makecode.microbit.org/)

### Flip a coin

Open [https://makecode.microbit.org/](https://makecode.microbit.org/)

![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/docs/microbit/interesting-case/cutebot-fun-football-game-kit/cases-libraries/images/makecode.png)

New Project

![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/docs/microbit/interesting-case/cutebot-fun-football-game-kit/cases-libraries/images/makecode-new-project-01.png)

Enter a project name and click Create.

### Write a program

Sample Program：[https://makecode.microbit.org/_Wu6gVgC4c9tj](https://makecode.microbit.org/_Wu6gVgC4c9tj)

![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/docs/microbit/interesting-case/cutebot-fun-football-game-kit/cases-libraries/images/microbit-basic-06.png)

You can also download the program directly from the following web page.

<div
    style={{
        position: 'relative',
        paddingBottom: '60%',
        overflow: 'hidden',
    }}
>
    <iframe
        src="https://makecode.microbit.org/_bk5A9eTmrE1c"
        frameborder="0"
        sandbox="allow-popups allow-forms allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
        style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
        }}
    />
</div>


From the Micro:bit Simulator area we can see the simulation of the program.

### How do I download the program to micro:bit?

Use a USB cable to connect your PC to the micro:bit V2.

![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/docs/microbit/interesting-case/microbit-smart-climate-kit/cases-libraries/images/connect-microbit.gif)

After a successful connection, a disk drive named `MICROBIT` is recognized on the computer.

### Results

After shaking the micro:bit, random `yes` or `happy` icons are displayed on the micro:bit's LED matrix.
