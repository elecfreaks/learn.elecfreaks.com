# After-Sales Policy

## Returns and Exchanges

We offer a 30-day return or exchange policy. To be eligible for a full refund, your item must be returned in the same condition that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags attached, and in its original packaging. Alternatively, if you receive a defective item, you must provide ELECFREAKS with pictures or videos as proof. If there are no quality issues with the product, the customer will bear the return shipping costs.

## Limited Warranty

ELECFREAKS warrants physical products against hardware failures that should not occur under normal use within 60 days from the date the original purchaser receives the retail purchase shipment. Under this limited warranty, if a hardware defect is discovered and ELECFREAKS receives a valid claim within the warranty period, ELECFREAKS will, to the extent permitted by law, repair the product using new or refurbished parts free of charge, replace the product with a new or refurbished product, or, with the customer's consent, send replacement parts by mail for the customer to repair themselves. If a hardware failure occurs, these are your sole and exclusive remedies within the scope permitted by law. Replacement products or parts assume the remaining warranty period of the original product. When replacing a product or part, any replacement item becomes your property, and the replaced item becomes ELECFREAKS's property. Parts provided by ELECFREAKS for the fulfillment of its warranty obligations must be used for the product requiring warranty service.
