# Penalty shootout

## Introduction

In soccer, Penalty Shootouts (Penalty Kicks) usually occur in the following situations:

Ties in Regular Time: In a standard 90-minute match, a penalty shootout is played if the teams are tied at the end of regular time and the match needs to decide a winner.

Ties after Extra Time: If the match provides for extra time, and the teams are tied after 90 minutes of regulation time, an additional 30 minutes of extra time (divided into two 15-minute halves) will be played. If the teams are still tied after extra time, a penalty shootout will be played.

SPECIFIC COMPETITION PHASES: In certain specific competitions, such as the knockout phase, the winner of each match must be decided. If neither regular time nor extra time can determine a winner, a penalty shootout is played to determine the final winner.

Friendly or exhibition matches: In some friendly or exhibition matches, if the two sides are tied within the allotted time, a penalty shootout may also be an option in order to increase the spectacle of the match and determine the winner.

The rule of penalty shootout is that each team takes turns to send 5 players to shoot on penalty kicks, and if both sides have the same number of goals after 5 rounds, the sudden death method will be played (i.e., each team takes turns to take penalties until one side misses and the other side shoots in).

Penalty shootout is a tense and exciting way of deciding the winner, which requires a high level of mental fitness and skill from the players.

## Programming

### Programming Platforms

We usually use [graphical programming platform makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/) to program micro:bit

Programming platform entry: [https://makecode.microbit.org/](https://makecode.microbit.org/)

### Trolley construction

Please follow the steps below to build the structure.

### Programming

You can try to write the program independently, and if you need to refer to it, you can jump to the [remote-control-car](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/docs/microbit/interesting-case/cutebot-fun-football-game-kit/cases-libraries/images/football-game-step-12.png) page.

### Results

Two cars are remotely controlled by two handles to play soccer.

### Classroom activity

Let the two teams of players take turns to play penalty kicks. Since the goal is small, consider setting the rule that the defending team enters the field from the corners of the map to prevent the carts from blocking the goal.
