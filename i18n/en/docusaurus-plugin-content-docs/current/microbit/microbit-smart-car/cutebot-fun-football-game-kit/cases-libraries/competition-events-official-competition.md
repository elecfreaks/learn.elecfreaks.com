# Official competition

## Introduction

A standard soccer match has 11 players on the field for each team, including a goalkeeper and 10 field players. In official international matches and most professional leagues, this number is fixed.
However, due to the number of fields and carts, we will only consider 1V1 cart soccer matches in this project.

## Teaching Objectives

Understand the basic rules of a soccer match.

Make a race cart using the Fun Football Race Kit.

To develop problem solving skills.

## Project Production

### Programming Platform

We usually use [graphical programming platform makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/) to program micro:bit

Programming platform entrance: [https://makecode.microbit.org/](https://makecode.microbit.org/)

### Car Construction

Please follow the steps below to build the structure.![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/docs/microbit/interesting-case/cutebot-fun-football-game-kit/cases-libraries/images/football-game-step-01.png)

### Programming

You can try to complete the programming independently. If you need reference, you can jump to the [remote-control-car](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/docs/microbit/interesting-case/cutebot-fun-football-game-kit/cases-libraries/images/football-game-step-12.png) page.

### Results

Use two handles to remotely control two cars to play football.
