### How to download programs to micro: bit?

Connect the PC and micro: bit V2 using a USB cable.

![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/docs/microbit/interesting-case/microbit-smart-climate-kit/cases-libraries/images/connect-microbit.gif)

After a successful connection, a disk drive named `MICROBIT` is recognized on the computer.

![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/docs/microbit/interesting-case/microbit-smart-climate-kit/cases-libraries/images/microbit-drive.png)

Click on the bottom left corner of![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/docs/microbit/interesting-case/microbit-smart-climate-kit/cases-libraries/images/download-01.png)，Select `Connect Device`.
