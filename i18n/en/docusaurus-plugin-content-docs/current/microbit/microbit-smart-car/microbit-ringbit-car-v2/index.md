# Introduction of Ring:bit car V2


The ELECFREAKS [Ring:bit Car](https://shop.elecfreaks.com/products/elecfreaks-micro-bit-ring-bit-v2-car-kit-without-micro-bit-board?_pos=4&_sid=66ba68dec&_ss=r) is a small DIY smart car driven by the BBC micro:bit and the ELECFREAKS Ring:bit. The Ring:bit extends the micro:bit's 3 GPIO ports and allow for different sensors and components to be easily attached to the micro:bit. A basic Ring:bit Car can be easily programmed to run autonomously, with a remote control, and even create rainbow beacons of light. Just add one of the many extensions available and your Ring:bit Car can do even more things like line and light following, obstacle avoiding, drawing and more!
