## Expanded Knowledge

*** Application scenarios of remote-controlled mechanical claw trolley ***

Remote-controlled mechanical claw trolley is a kind of unmanned vehicle equipped with mechanical claw, which can be operated by remote control to move and control the action of mechanical claw. The following are some application scenarios of remote-controlled mechanical claw carts:

Logistics and warehousing: Remote-controlled gripper trolleys can be used in logistics and warehousing areas for handling and stacking goods. The operator can control the movement of the trolley through the remote control and use the mechanical claw to grab, carry or stack the goods, improving logistics efficiency and reducing labour costs.

Search and Rescue: In disaster rescue or search and rescue missions, the remote-controlled mechanical claw trolley can be used to carry and operate rescue tools. It can travel through narrow or dangerous terrain to reach hard-to-reach areas and use the mechanical claw for tasks such as item handling, obstacle removal or personnel rescue.

Environmental monitoring and cleaning: The remote-controlled mechanical claw cart can be used for environmental monitoring and cleaning tasks. It can carry sensor devices, such as cameras or gas sensors, for environmental data collection and monitoring. At the same time, the mechanical claw can be used to remove rubbish, pick up debris or carry out cleaning work to improve environmental tidiness and sustainable development.

Building and construction: In the building and construction sector, the remote-controlled mechanical claw trolley can be used to carry and place building materials, such as bricks and steel bars. It can transport materials to designated locations through narrow construction spaces and use the mechanical claw for precise placement, improving construction efficiency and reducing manual labour.

Agriculture and horticulture: The remote-controlled mechanical claw trolley has potential applications in agriculture and horticulture. It can be used for agricultural operations such as sowing, harvesting, weeding or fertilising. The claw can grab and handle crops, while the mobility of the trolley can be adapted to different agricultural or horticultural sites.
