## Expanded knowledge

***  History and development of stone-throwing devices***

A stone-throwing device is an ancient siege tool used to throw large stones, projectiles, or other offensive objects. The following is an overview of the history and development of stone-throwing devices:

Ancient stone throwing devices:
Ancient civilisations around the world used stone-throwing devices. Among the earliest stone-throwing devices date back to the Assyrian Empire in the 9th century BC. Assyrian armies used crossbow-shaped projectiles, called "bellows," to attack cities and besiege enemies. During the Greek and Roman periods, more sophisticated stone-throwing machines were invented, such as the famous stone-throwing machines "cuirasses" and "crossbow-shaped stone-throwing machines".

Medieval stone-throwing devices:
During the Middle Ages, stone-throwing devices were widely used in European warfare. The most famous of these was the Trebuchet, a huge mechanical device that used the counter weighing principle to throw huge stones. Trebuchet became one of the most powerful and effective stone-throwing devices in medieval siege warfare.

Modern stone-throwing devices:
With the invention of gunpowder and advances in artillery shell technology, stone-throwing devices were gradually replaced by artillery. However, the concept and principles of stone-throwing devices still exist and are used in some special situations. For example, stone-throwing devices are used in modern military manoeuvres to simulate ancient war scenarios in order to enhance the realism of historical re-enactments.

Modern Applications:
Although stone-throwing devices are no longer widely used in the military, they are still used in other areas. For example, some athletic competitions use small stone-throwing devices to test the accuracy and range of stone-throwing. In addition, the principles of stone-throwing devices also provide reference and inspiration for modern catapulting devices and engineering machinery.

Overall, the stone-throwing device is an important siege weapon in human history, representing the development of ancient technology and warfare techniques. Although it has been eliminated in modern warfare, the stone-throwing device still has its unique value in the fields of historical research, cultural activities and athletic competitions.
