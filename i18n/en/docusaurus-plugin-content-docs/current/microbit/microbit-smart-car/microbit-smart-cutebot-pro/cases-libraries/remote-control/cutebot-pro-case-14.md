## Teaching Process

### Course Introduction

Hello everyone! Today we will continue our smart car production project. This time we will use the joystick:bit gamepad to control the car. In the process, we will learn the wireless communication function of the micro:bit.

### Inquiry activities

How to use the joystick:bit game controller to control the driving of the car?

How to distinguish your own car from other people's cars without interfering with each other?

In group discussions, students are encouraged to share their views and ideas.

## Summary and Reflection

Review course content to remind students of what knowledge and skills they have acquired.

Guide students to discuss the problems and difficulties they encountered in the production process, and how to solve these problems.

## Outreach Activities

Let students try not only to control the driving of the car, but also to control the lighting effect of the car or switch functions such as line inspection, obstacle avoidance, and remote control through the buttons on the gamepad.
