## Summary and Reflection

Review course content to remind students of what knowledge and skills they have acquired.

Guide students to discuss the problems and difficulties they encountered in the production process, and how to solve these problems.

## Outreach Activities

Let students try not only to control the driving of the car, but also to control the lighting effect of the car or switch functions such as line inspection, obstacle avoidance, and remote control through the buttons on the gamepad.
