### Connections of the AI Lens:

Connect the RJ11 cable with the [AI Lens](https://www.elecfreaks.com/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit.html) and the other end in Dupont connection to the circled place in the below picture (make sure you connect to the right connections).

***Tips:*** the bricks holder here is flexible to be adjusted, we may manually adjust the angles of the [AI Lens](https://www.elecfreaks.com/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit.html) to meet the requirements of the functions that you want to achieve.

## Software Platform:

## Programming

### Step 1

- Click “Advanced” in the drawer to see more choices.

- We need to add a package for programming. Click “Extensions” in the bottom of the drawer and search with “cutebot” in the dialogue box to download it.

We need to add a package for programming the [AI Lens](https://www.elecfreaks.com/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit.html) kit. Click “Extensions” in the bottom of the drawer and search with “https://github.com/elecfreaks/pxt-PlanetX-AI” in the dialogue box to download it.

***Note:*** If you met a tip indicating that the codebase will be deleted due to incompatibility, you may continue as the tips say or build a new project in the menu.

###  Step 2

- In the “on start” brick, initialize the [AI Lens](https://www.elecfreaks.com/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit.html) and switch the function to the cards recognition mode, set the micro:bit to display the appointed icon.

- In the “forever” brick, set to get one image form the [AI Lens](https://www.elecfreaks.com/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit.html) and judge the cards icon on the image. If it reconizes the "forward" icon, we set the speed of the left wheel at the speed of 50% and the right at the same to make the car go forward; if  it recognizes a "turn-left" icon, we set the car to turn left for 0.5s at the speed of 30% and then move forward, note the [AI Lens](https://www.elecfreaks.com/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit.html) has three buffers and we need get three images to clear the buffer after the execution. If  it recognizes a "turn-right" icon, we set the car to turn right for 0.5s at the speed of 30% and then move forward. Note the [AI Lens](https://www.elecfreaks.com/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit.html) has three buffers and we need get three images to clear the buffer after the execution. If it recognizes the "stop" icon, the car stops moving accordingly.

            height: '100%',
        }}
    />
</div>


## Result
---
If the [AI Lens](https://www.elecfreaks.com/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit.html) regognizes the "forward" card, the car moves forward; if it recognizes the "turn-left" card, the car turns left and then goes forward; if it recognizes the "turn-right" card, the car turns right and then goes forward; if it recognizes the "stop" card, the car stops moving.
