### Connections of the AI Lens:

Connect the RJ11 cable with the [AI Lens](https://www.elecfreaks.com/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit.html) and the other end in Dupont connection to the circled place in the below picture (make sure you connect to the right connections).

***Tips:*** the bricks holder here is flexible to be adjusted, we may manually adjust the angles of the [AI Lens](https://www.elecfreaks.com/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit.html) to meet the requirements of the functions that you want to achieve.

## Software Platform:

## Programming

### Step 1

Click “Advanced” in the drawer to see more choices.

- We need to add a package for programming. Click “Extensions” in the bottom of the drawer and search with “cutebot” in the dialogue box to download it.

We need to add a package for programming the [AI Lens](https://www.elecfreaks.com/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit.html) kit. Click “Extensions” in the bottom of the drawer and search with “https://github.com/elecfreaks/pxt-PlanetX-AI” in the dialogue box to download it.

***Note:*** If you met a tip indicating that the codebase will be deleted due to incompatibility, you may continue as the tips say or build a new project in the menu.

###  Step 2

- In the “on start” brick, initialize the [AI Lens](https://www.elecfreaks.com/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit.html) and switch the function to the color recognition mode, set the RainbowLED lights connect to P15 port.

- In the “forever” brick, set to get one image form the [AI Lens](https://www.elecfreaks.com/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit.html) and judge the cards color on the image. If it reconizes the white color, we set the LED headlights and signal lights in white; if we recognizes the blue color, we set the LED headlights and signal lights in blue, by analogy, we programme with green, red, yellow and black card in the same way.

            height: '100%',
        }}
    />
</div>


## Result
---
- The lights change the color in accordance with the color of the cards.
