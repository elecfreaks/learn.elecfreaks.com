### Connections of the AI Lens:

Connect the RJ11 cable with the [AI Lens](https://www.elecfreaks.com/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit.html) and the other end in Dupont connection to the circled place in the below picture (make sure you connect to the right connections).

### Step 1

Click “Advanced” in the drawer to see more choices.

- We need to add a package for programming. Click “Extensions” in the bottom of the drawer and search with “cutebot” in the dialogue box to download it.

We need to add a package for programming the [AI Lens](https://www.elecfreaks.com/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit.html) kit. Click “Extensions” in the bottom of the drawer and search with “https://github.com/elecfreaks/pxt-PlanetX-AI” in the dialogue box to download it.

***Note:*** If you met a tip indicating that the codebase will be deleted due to incompatibility, you may continue as the tips say or build a new project in the menu.

###  Step 2

- In the on start brick, initialize the [AI Lens](https://www.elecfreaks.com/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit.html) and switch to characters acquisition function.

- While press the button A, set the learnt target as ID1.

- In the “forever” brick, set to get one image form the [AI Lens](https://www.elecfreaks.com/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit.html). If the ID1 is in the image, we set the color of the headlights in blue and set a √ to display on the screen. Or set the color of the headlights in red and set a × to display on the screen.
