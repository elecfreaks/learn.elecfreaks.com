### Connections of the AI Lens:

Connect the RJ11 cable with the [AI Lens](https://www.elecfreaks.com/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit.html) and the other end in Dupont connection to the circled place in the below picture (make sure you connect to the right connections).

### Step 1

Click “Advanced” in the drawer to see more choices.

***Note:*** If you met a tip indicating that the codebase will be deleted due to incompatibility, you may continue as the tips say or build a new project in the menu.

###  Step 2

- In the on start brick, initialize the [AI Lens](https://www.elecfreaks.com/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit.html) and switch to face recognition function.

- In the “forever” brick, set to get one image form the [AI Lens](https://www.elecfreaks.com/elecfreaks-smart-ai-lens-kit.html). If a face is on the image, set the LED screen to display √; or set to display ×.
