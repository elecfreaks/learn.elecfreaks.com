## Materials

1 x Cutebot kit

1 x Line-tracking Map Homemade or enclosed in the Cutebot kit

## Software Platform


[MicroSoft makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/#)

## Programming


### Step 1

Click the "Advanced" to see more choices in the MakeCode drawer.

A codebase is required for Cutebot programming, click “Add Package” at the bottom of the drawer, search `Cutebot` in the dialogue box and download it.

***Note:*** If you met a tip indicating incompatibility of the codebase, you can continue with the tips or build a new project there.

### Step 2

Choose "show icon" in the `On start`brick.

### Step 3

Drag three `if` bricks into the `Forever` brick.

Judge if the status of line-tracking sensors is  ○ ●, saying the left probe doesn't detect the black line while the right probe detects the black line.

Set the left wheel speed to `50` and right to `25`,  make a right turn by the different speed of the two wheels and go back to the black line.

Judge if the status of line-tracking sensors is  ● ○ and make a left turn to go back to the black line.

When the status is ● ● that means the Cutebot runs along with the black line at the speed of `50`.

            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
        }}
    />
</div>


## Result

The Cutebot runs along the black line and will adjust to run back to the black line if any deviation happens.
