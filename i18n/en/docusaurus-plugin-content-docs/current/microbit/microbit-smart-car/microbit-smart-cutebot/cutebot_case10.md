***Note:*** If you met a tip indicating incompatibility of the codebase, you can continue with the tips or build a new project there.

### Step 2

Drag the "set left wheel speed and right wheel speed" into the `On start` brick.

### Step 3

Set a `Sonar` variable to  save the detected `Cm` value in the `Forever` brick.

If the detected value is between`5` and `10` , the car stops moving.

If the detected value is below`5` , the car reverses because of the short distance with the hands.

If not any, the car moves forward to catch up with the hands because of the far distance with the hands and then stay still .
