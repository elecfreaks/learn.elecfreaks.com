## Materials

1 x Cutebot Kit

1 x [micro:bit](https://www.elecfreaks.com/microbit_edu.html)

## Software Platform


[MicroSoft makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/#)

## Programming


### Step 1

Click the "Advanced" to see more choices in the MakeCode drawer.

***Note:*** If you met a tip indicating incompatibility of the codebase, you can continue with the tips or build a new project there.

### Step 2: Remote Control Programming

Set the "radio set group" to `1` in the `On start` brick.

Send radio number in `1` when pressing button A.

Send radio number in `2` when pressing button B.

Send radio number in `3` when pressing button A+B.

You can also download it directly below:

<div
    style={{
        position: 'relative',
        paddingBottom: '60%',
        overflow: 'hidden',
    }}
>
    <iframe
        src="https://makecode.microbit.org/_9JCE5Ta78DL9"
        frameborder="0"
        sandbox="allow-popups allow-forms allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
        style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
        }}
    />
</div>

### Step 3: Cutebot Programming


Drag "show icon" brick into the `On start` brick and set the "radio set group" to `1`. Items must be the same with the remote control for the correct match.

Drag three "if" bricks into the `on radio received` brick and judge if the received number is `1`,  `2` or `3`.

When the received number is `1`, turn left.

When the received number is `2`, turn right.

When the received number is `3`, go straight.

            height: '100%',
        }}
    />
</div>

## Result

When button A+B being pressed on the remote control, the Cutebot goes straight.

When button A being pressed on the remote control, the Cutebot turns left.

When button B being pressed on the remote control, the Cutebot turns right.
