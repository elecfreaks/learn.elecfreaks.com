***Note:*** If you met a tip indicating the codebase will be deleted due to incompatibility, you may continue as the tips tell or build a new project.

### Step 2

Judge the luminous intensity with the block "light level " in "forever" ; if the value is below the setting point, set the Cutebot turn left at its full speed; Or it moves forward at its full speed.
