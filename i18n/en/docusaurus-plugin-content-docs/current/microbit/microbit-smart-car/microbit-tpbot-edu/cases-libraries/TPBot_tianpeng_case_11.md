# Case 11: Following a car with a fixed distance

## Introduction

This course aims to guide students to create a case of following a car with a fixed distance, combining the functions of micro:bit to create the case.

## Teaching objectives

Understand the principle of following a car with a fixed distance: learn how to monitor the distance of the car in front through sensors and adjust the speed of the car according to this distance.

## Teaching preparation

Before starting teaching, please make sure you have prepared the following necessary materials:

## Course Introduction

Welcome to our latest course - Fixed Distance Following Technology. In this course, we will explore how to make our car automatically maintain a safe distance from the car in front of it during driving, just like an experienced driver. This is a practical and challenging technology that involves sensor application, data processing, and intelligent decision-making.

## Exploration Activities

## Conclusion

The car automatically maintains the distance from the car in front.

## Extended knowledge

**Application of ultrasonic sensors in life**
Ultrasonic sensors have been widely used in various fields due to their non-contact measurement, high accuracy, and fast response. The following are some examples of the application of ultrasonic sensors in life:

1. Automobile assisted driving system
Ultrasonic sensors are widely used in automobile assisted driving systems, such as reversing radar. They help drivers perceive the surrounding environment through multiple probes installed around the vehicle, provide blind spot detection, and remind drivers when someone is in the blind spot.

2. Industrial automation
In the field of industrial automation, ultrasonic sensors are used to detect the position and distance of products to ensure the accuracy and safety of the production process, including material handling and positioning control on assembly lines.

3. Liquid level monitoring
Ultrasonic sensors are suitable for real-time monitoring of liquid height in various storage tanks, and are widely used in liquid level monitoring of reservoirs, water tanks, and chemical tanks.

4. Smart home
Ultrasonic sensors are also widely used in smart homes, such as automatic doors, smart trash cans, and anti-theft systems, providing a convenient and safe home environment.
