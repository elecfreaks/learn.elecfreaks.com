>The micro:bit V2 is combined with the expansion board and the microUSB is connected to the micro:bit V2.
>In this case, if power is supplied from the micro:bit V2 side, the expansion board's power switch will conduct regardless of the switch.
>The expansion board power switch will control if power is supplied from the expansion board side.

## Programming Platform

Arcade game programming platform address: [https://arcade.makecode.com](https://arcade.makecode.com)

### Programming Page Introduction

1. Click on number 1 to create a project and start programming. 2.
2. The section below number 2 contains some simple tutorials provided by the platform and game creations shared by the community.

**The programming interface introduction, for basic beginners roughly divided into three parts needs to understand **

1. online simulator: follow the logic of the code to simulate the effect of real-time operation
2. Programming Block Bar: We drag the programming code from here to the program.
3. code editing area: we drag the code out of the block bar and put it together here to complete the image, interface, and logic of the game.

# Program Download Steps

Since the micro:bit V2 (nRF52833) is still in beta for the official Arcade platform, we need to first go to the platform's settings page to open up the hardware options that are still in the trial version.

Click on the small gear in the upper right corner of the programming screen and select About.

![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/docs/microbit/expansion-board/microbit-retro-arcade-se/quick-start/images/microbit-retro-arcade-16.png)

Select Experiment on the pop-up page.

![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/docs/microbit/expansion-board/microbit-retro-arcade-se/quick-start/images/microbit-retro-arcade-17.png)

Make sure Expermental Hardware is enabled (you only need to set it once).

![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/docs/microbit/expansion-board/microbit-retro-arcade-se/quick-start/images/microbit-retro-arcade-18.png)

Then go back to the programming homepage, click on the Download button in the lower left corner, and in the Select Hardware pop-up window pull down to the bottom and select `micro:bit Retro Shield`.
