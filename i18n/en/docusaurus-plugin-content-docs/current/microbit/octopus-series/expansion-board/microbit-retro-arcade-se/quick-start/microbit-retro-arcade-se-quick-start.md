>The micro:bit V2 is combined with the expansion board and the microUSB is connected to the micro:bit V2.
>In this case, if power is supplied from the micro:bit V2 side, the expansion board's power switch will conduct regardless of the switch.
>The expansion board power switch will control if power is supplied from the expansion board side.

**The programming interface introduction, for basic beginners is roughly divided into three parts needs to understand **

1. online simulator: follow the logic of the code to simulate the effect of real-time operation
2. Programming Block Bar: We drag in the programming code from here to the program.
3. code editing area: we drag the code out of the block bar and put it together here to complete the image, interface, and logic of the game.
