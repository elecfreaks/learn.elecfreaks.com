You can also download the program directly through the webpage below; once downloaded, you can start running the program.

<div
    style={{
        position: 'relative',
        paddingBottom: '60%',
        overflow: 'hidden',
    }}
>
    <iframe
        src="https://makecode.microbit.org/_bu8MeHhgkP4o"
        frameborder="0"
        sandbox="allow-popups allow-forms allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
        style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
        }}
    />
</div>
