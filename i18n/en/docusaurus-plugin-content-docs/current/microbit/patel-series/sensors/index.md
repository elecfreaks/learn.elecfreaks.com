# Petal Series Sensors

## Product Introduction
**Petal Series:** The name "Petal" reflects the essence of our sensors: a modular design where each component is like a petal, combining to form a complete and innovative educational ecosystem. Just like the meticulously crafted petals in nature, each module is carefully designed to provide users with a powerful professional-grade experience.


## Product Features

**Color Recognition System**

Supports a color recognition system. The colors of sensor ports, expansion board ports, and software building blocks on makecode are unified, reducing the difficulty for students to get started and effectively improving classroom efficiency.

**Fool-proof Interface**

Adopts a fool-proof interface design to prevent reverse insertion.

**Building Block Compatibility**

The fixing interface of structural components is compatible with building block spacing, allowing sensors or expansion boards to be installed on building blocks with screws.
