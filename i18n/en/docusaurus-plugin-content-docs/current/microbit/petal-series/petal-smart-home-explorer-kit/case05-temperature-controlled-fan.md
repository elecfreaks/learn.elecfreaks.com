# Temperature-Controlled Fan

## Introduction

Welcome to the class on making a temperature-controlled fan! This project uses a micro:bit board, OLED display, temperature-humidity sensor, and fan module to build a smart small fan that can "sense temperature," allowing you to experience the integration of technology and daily life.

## Teaching Objectives

- Understand the function of the temperature-humidity sensor and learn to read temperature data.
- Master the control method of the fan module and the display logic of the OLED screen.
- Use graphical programming to implement the intelligent logic of "temperature triggering fan on/off."

## Teaching Preparations

Before starting the class, please ensure you have prepared the following necessary materials:

| **Image**                                                    | **Name**                | **Quantity** | **Remarks**        |

These materials will provide you with a complete experience to ensure you can smoothly proceed with subsequent operations and learning. If you have prepared the above, we can continue to the next step.

## Course Introduction

When doing homework in summer, it's troublesome to manually switch the fan on and off. Can we make the fan "know" when to turn on by itself? Today, we will make a **temperature-controlled fan**: when the temperature exceeds the set value, the fan automatically starts to blow air; when the temperature drops, the fan automatically stops. It acts like a considerate assistant to help us maintain a comfortable study environment!

## Project Production

### Hardware Connection

- Connect the temperature-humidity sensor and OLED display to the IIC interface of the Petal Base Expansion Board.
- Connect the fan module to the J1 interface of the Petal Base Expansion Board.

## Extended Knowledge

**Applications of Temperature-Controlled Fans in Daily Life**

### 1. Home Scenarios

- **Bedroom/Study**: Replaces traditional manual fans to automatically adjust indoor temperature.
- **Pet Nest/Plant Corner**: Provides a comfortable temperature environment for small animals or plants (e.g., succulents are sensitive to high temperatures).

### 2. Creative Modifications

- **Desktop Mini Air Conditioner**: Place ice cubes in front of the fan for enhanced cooling.
- **Humidifying Fan**: Combine with a spray bottle to humidify while cooling (additional materials needed).

### 3. Other Scenarios

- **Invention Expansion**: Add LED lights to the fan to display colorful lights when rotating.
- **Energy-Saving Design**: Automatically increase wind power during bright daytime and reduce it in dim nighttime.
