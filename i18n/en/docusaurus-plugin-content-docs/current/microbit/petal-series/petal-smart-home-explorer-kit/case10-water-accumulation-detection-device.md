# Water Accumulation Detection Device

## Introduction

In this project, we will learn how to make a water accumulation detection device.



**Note: This case cannot use the set of structural parts to simulate the application scenario, but can realize the basic case production.**

## Teaching Objectives

Review the use of water level sensors

## Teaching Preparation

Before starting the teaching, please make sure you have prepared the following necessary materials:

| **Picture**                                                  | **Name**                | **Quantity** | **Remarks**         |

These materials will provide you with a complete experience and ensure that you can proceed smoothly with the subsequent operations and learning. If you have prepared the above contents, we can move on to the next step.

## Course Introduction

In this class, we will make a water accumulation detection device. When the water level sensor detects water accumulation, it will automatically display a red light for warning.

## Project Production

### Hardware Connection

Connect the water level sensor to the J1 interface of the Petal Basic Expansion Board,

Connect the RGB LED to the J2 interface of the Petal Basic Expansion Board.

You can also download the program directly through the following web page.

<div
    style={{
        position: 'relative',
        paddingBottom: '60%',
        overflow: 'hidden',
    }}
>
    <iframe
        src="https://makecode.microbit.org/_c7CdYvVfHJRE"
        frameborder="0"
        sandbox="allow-popups allow-forms allow-scripts allow-same-origin"
        style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
        }}
    />
</div>




### How to Download the Program to micro:bit?

Use a USB cable to connect the PC and micro:bit V2.
