# Auto Windows

## Introduction

In this project, we will learn how to make an intelligent noise - controlling door and window.



**Note: This case cannot use the set of structural parts to simulate the application scenario, but can realize the basic case production.**

## Teaching Objectives

Review the functions of micro:bit

Understand the hazards of noise

## Teaching Preparation

Before starting the teaching, please make sure you have prepared the following necessary materials:

| **Picture**                                                  | **Name**                | **Quantity** | **Remarks**         |

These materials will provide you with a complete experience and ensure that you can proceed smoothly with the subsequent operations and learning. If you have prepared the above contents, we can move on to the next step.

## Course Introduction

In this class, we will make an intelligent noise - controlling door and window. When the micro:bit detects that the noise exceeds the threshold, it will automatically rotate the servo to close the door and window.

## Project Production

### Hardware Connection

Connect the Adapter to the J1 interface of the Petal Basic Expansion Board.

Connect the 180° servo to the S1 interface of the Adapter.

### Programming Platform

We usually use the [graphical programming platform makecode](https://makecode.microbit.org/) to program the micro:bit.



Programming platform entrance: https://makecode.microbit.org/

### How to Download the Program to micro:bit?

Use a USB cable to connect the PC and micro:bit V2.
