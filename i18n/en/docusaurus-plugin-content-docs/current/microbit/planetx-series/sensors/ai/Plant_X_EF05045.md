# Products Introduction

## Introduction

The AI Lens is an easy-to-use AI camera that supports face recognition, colour recognition, card recognition, line tracking, ball recognition, machine learning and more. It encapsulates complex AI concepts into hardware modules that are perceivable, understandable and fun for students.

AI training can be completed with just one button, getting rid of tedious training and complex visual algorithms, allowing you to focus more on the conception and implementation of the project.

## When using RJ11 to Dupont connector cable

If you use a micro:bit expansion board without RJ11 expansion port, due to the weak power supply ability of the USB port of the micro:bit, you need to choose an expansion board that uses an external power supply USB port or lithium battery for power supply, such as the Sensor:bit, IOT:bit, Wukong Expansion Board and so on.

When using micro:bit expansion boards without RJ11 expansion interface, you can use the RJ11 to DuPont cable to connect the RJ11 interface to the AI Lens, the black wire of the DuPont interface end connects to GND, the red wire connects to VCC, the green wire connects to the P19 (SCL) port, and the yellow wire connects to the P20 (SDA) port; if the AI Lens fails to start up in the process of using it, try to supply power to the AI Lens with separate power supply.

Take IoT:bit for an example

![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/microbit/sensor/planet-x-sensors/ai/images/05035_04.png)

Note:

1. When using a micro:bit expansion board other than the Nezha expansion board to connect to the AI lens, the requested extension should be searched with "PlanetX-AI"

2. When using the one-click learning function, if the power is restarted, the item needs to be re-learned.

3. After downloading the program, if you find that the AI Lens is on the startup page and cannot run properly, you need to completely power off and then reboot to ensure that the AI Lens is initialised successfully.





## The firmware update of AI Lens

AI Lens will be updated with some new features and performance optimisation from time to time, you need to manually update the firmware of AI Lens after releasing the new version of firmware.

*Note: There are two hardware versions of AiCam-AiCam V1.2 and AiCam V1.7, and the firmware of the two versions are not common*.

### How to check the firmware version

There are AiCam V1.2 and V1.7 for the AI lens, and there is a firmware download button on the back of the AiCam V1.7  we are able to differentiate these two versions by the download button or the version number.

### FAQ

1. If under the macOS system, during the process of installing the firmware download software, the installation fails because the developer cannot be verified.

![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/microbit/sensor/planet-x-sensors/ai/images/AI-gj-07.png)

Please visit [https://support.apple.com/zh-cn/HT202491](https://support.apple.com/zh-cn/HT202491) for solutions.

2. When using the AI lens, an error message appears when clicking download, it may be that the software library of PlanetX has been damaged.

![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/microbit/sensor/planet-x-sensors/ai/images/AI-FAQ-01.png)

There are two possible situations:

(1) The software library is relatively old, please create a new project, re-add the software library and test again.


(2) To add conflicts between the PlanetX software library and the PlanetX-AI software library at the same time, please click the red box "JaveScript" in the figure to switch the programming interface, click the resource manager, and delete the PlanetX software library or PlanetX-AI software library as needed;

![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/i18n/en/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/microbit/sensor/planet-x-sensors/ai/images/AI-FAQ-03.png)

After deletion, there should be no more error prompts in the explorer;

If you find that the building blocks are lost after deletion, please try to re-add the corresponding software library. If re-adding the software library does not solve the problem, please reset the makecode programming platform as shown in the figure below. Note: After resetting the platform, all projects saved on makecode will be cleared. Please save the project files to the computer if needed.
