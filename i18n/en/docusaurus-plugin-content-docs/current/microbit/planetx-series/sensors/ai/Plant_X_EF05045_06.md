            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
        }}
    />
</div>


### Result
 Press button A to recognize the object and give it an ID 1; press button B to recognize the object and give it an ID 2. Then the equivalent ID number should display on the micro:bit in accordance with the object that you place in the front of the AI Lens.
