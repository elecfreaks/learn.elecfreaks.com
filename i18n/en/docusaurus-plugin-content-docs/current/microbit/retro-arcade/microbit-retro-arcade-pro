## Programming Platform

Arcade game programming platform address: [https://arcade.makecode.com](https://arcade.makecode.com)

### Programming page introduction

1. Click on the section numbered 1 and enter the project name to create a project to start programming
2. The following part of number 2 is a simple tutorial provided by some platforms and the game works shared by the community

**Introduction to the programming interface, for the basic introduction to the first roughly divided into 3 parts need to understand**

1. Online simulator: Simulate the running effect in real time according to the logic of the code
2. Programming blocks bar: we drag in programming code from here for programming
3. Code editing area: we drag out the code from the block bar and put it together here to finish building the image, interface and logic of the game

## Game Download

### Download steps

Since the micro:bit V2 (nRF52833) is still in beta for the Arcade platform officials, we need to first go to the platform's settings page to open up the hardware options that are still in the trial version.

![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/docs/microbit/expansion-board/images/microbit-retro-arcade-17.png)

Make sure Expermental Hardware is enabled (you only need to set it once)


![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/docs/microbit/expansion-board/images/microbit-retro-arcade-18.png)

Then go back to the programming home page, click on the download button in the bottom left corner, and in the pop-up select hardware window pull down to the bottom and select N3


![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/docs/microbit/expansion-board/images/microbit-retro-arcade-19.png)

You will get a file in .hex format, drag it into the MICROBIT drive to run it on micro:bit V2 + Microbit Retro Arcade.
