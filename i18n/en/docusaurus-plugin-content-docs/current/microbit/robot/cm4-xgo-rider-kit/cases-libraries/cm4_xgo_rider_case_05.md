Please do not place XGO Rider on the edge of the table or in dangerous places to avoid damage. At the same time, the TF card of XGO Rider is burned with the image at the factory. You can directly insert the TF card into the Raspberry Pi for use. In general, there is no need to burn the image system according to this tutorial! ! ! **

Please do not place XGO Rider on the edge of the table or in dangerous places to avoid damage. **

### 1. Preparation

Hardware: Prepare an SD card reader, which needs to be USB 3.0. Pull out the SD card of the robot dog and insert it into the card reader, and then plug it into the USB port of the computer.

Software: Download [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) and install it.

### 2. Start Raspberry Pi Imager

### 3. Select the operating system and image file

Download the latest [Raspberry Pi system image](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YJy-wIke6EJECcblV2LMFmRN6YSrPW-a), click "Select operating system" and choose to use a custom image and storage card path.

Click Burn, and it will be completed in about 20 minutes.

**Note that the system will prompt you to format, do not format the SD card. **
