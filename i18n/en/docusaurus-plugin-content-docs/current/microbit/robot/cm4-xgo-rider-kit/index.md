# XGO-Rider Dual-wheeled Foot Robot Kit-CM4 Version Introduction

## Introduction

---

CM4 XGO-Rider is a desktop-level dual-wheeled foot development platform based on Raspberry Pi, with built-in Raspberry Pi CM4 module to realize AI edge computing applications, using 4.5KG.CM all-metal magnetic encoding bus serial port servo as joints, FOC wheel hub integrated motor as wheels, and internally equipped with inertial measurement unit (IMU), which can adjust joint angles in real time according to different terrain feedback to achieve omnidirectional movement, posture stability, multiple motion superposition and other actions. Support Python programming and ROS programming, support wireless remote control, face recognition, gesture recognition, color tracking, object detection, license plate recognition, QR code motion control and other intelligent functions. Integrate iFlytek Spark large model, support voice dialogue communication, text-to-picture, picture-to-text and other AI functions. Provide systematic and rich learning tutorials to help you quickly get started with dual-wheeled foot robot intelligent control.
