## XGO Serial Communication Protocol

### Document Purpose and Target

This document applies to the communication protocol for command/data interaction between any host computer and the XGO series machine driver board. It is intended for advanced developers to perform secondary development on XGO.

### Software interface

Uses standard TTL serial communication.

| Baud rate  | 115200 |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Data bits  | 8      |
| Stop bits  | 1      |
| Parity bit | No     |

**Data frame format**

The data frame uses a fixed format: frame header + frame length + data + checksum + frame tail.

| Frame Header | Fixed to 0x55 0x00                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Frame length | The number of bytes in the entire data frame                 |
| Data         | It has different meanings depending on the instruction type, see the second part |
| Checksum     | Add all bytes of the length and data, take the lowest byte, and then invert it |
| Frame end    | Fixed to 0x00 0xAA                                           |

### Instructions

It is recommended that the interval between each instruction of the host computer is at least 1ms to prevent the robot dog from losing packets due to sending instructions too quickly.

You can refer to the send and read codes in the python library.

#### Write command, no response (0x00)

| **Frame header** | **Frame Length** | **Command type** | **First address** | **Data** | **Checksum** | **Frame end** |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| 0x55 0x00        |                  | 0x00             |                   | data     |              | 0x00 0xAA     |

The write command will modify the data starting from the first address and will not generate a response.

\>For example, to modify the forward speed of the robot dog, the forward speed address is 0x30, and it moves at the maximum speed, that is, the speed content is 0xFF. The specific instructions are as follows:
\>0x55 0x00 0x09 0x00 **0x30** **0xFF** 0xC7 0x00 0xAA
\>The checksum calculation process is as follows:
\>0x09+0x00+0x30+0xFF=0x138, take the lowest byte 0x38, and invert it to get 0xC7

#### Read command, response (0x02)

| **Frame header** | **Frame Length** | **Command type** | **First address** | **Read Length** | **Checksum** | **Frame end** |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| 0x55 0x00        |                  | 0x02             |                   | uint_8          |              | 0x00 0xAA     |

The write command will continuously read data starting from the first address and will not generate a response.
The format of the returned data packet is:

| **Frame header** | **Frame Length** | **Command type** | **First address** | **Data** | **Checksum** | **Frame end** |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| 0x55 0x00        |                  | 0x12             |                   | data     |              | 0x00 0xAA     |

\>For example, to read the angles of 12 servos, 0x50 is the address of the first servo position, and 0x0C means to read 12 servos in succession. The specific instructions are as follows:
\>0x55 0x00 0x09 0x02 0x50 0x0C 0x98 0x00 0xAA
\>The checksum calculation process is as follows:
\>0x09+0x02+0x50+0x0C=0x67, inverted to get 0x98
\>Read the return data packet:
\>0x55 0x00 0x14 0x12 0x50 0x80 0x80 0x80 0x80 0x80 0x80 0x80 0x80 0x80 0x80 0x80 0x89 0x00 0xAA
