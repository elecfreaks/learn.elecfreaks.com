  ## Product composition

  ### FOC wheel hub integrated motor

  XGO Rider uses FOC wheel hub integrated motor. FOC wheel hub integrated motor refers to a type of motor that combines FOC (Field-Oriented Control, field-oriented control or vector control) technology with a wheel hub motor. FOC technology is an advanced motor control method that optimizes motor performance by precisely controlling the motor magnetic field, allowing the motor to run more efficiently and smoothly and provide better dynamic response.

  #### Core features

  - **High integration**: FOC wheel hub integrated motor installs the motor directly in the wheel hub, reducing the complexity and weight of the transmission system and improving the overall integration.
  - **Direct drive**: Since the motor is directly mounted inside the wheel hub, no traditional transmission components such as chains, belts or gears are required, achieving direct drive.
  - **High efficiency and energy saving**: The application of FOC technology enables the motor to maintain high efficiency during operation, reducing energy loss, thereby achieving energy saving.
  - **Fast response**: FOC control can quickly adjust the output of the motor, making the motor respond faster to changes in speed and torque.
  - **Smooth operation**: Since FOC technology can accurately control the magnetic field of the motor, the motor runs more smoothly and with lower noise.
