### XGO-Rider: Every Step to Explore the Future

In the lab of ELECFREAKS, a group of passionate engineers and designers came together with a common goal: to create a robot that can both inspire children's curiosity and teach them valuable skills. After countless days and nights of hard work, XGO-Rider was born - a palm-sized bipedal robot based on micro:bit, designed to bring STEAM education to every family.

The design of XGO-Rider embodies the hard work of the ELECFREAKS team. It uses 4.5KG.CM all-metal magnetic encoding bus serial port servo as joints to ensure the precision and stability of each movement. The FOC wheel hub integrated motor gives XGO-Rider unparalleled flexibility and stability, enabling 360° full-range movement. The internal IMU sensor can monitor the status of the robot in real time to ensure that it can maintain balance even in complex environments.

XGO-Rider has excellent motion performance. The shoulder joint is precisely controlled by a 360° magnetic encoder, and the roll angle can reach plus or minus 20°, which means it can perform a variety of complex movements. Whether it is walking gracefully on flat ground or crossing obstacles steadily on uneven ground, XGO-Rider can do it with ease.

The built-in IMU sensor of XGO-Rider not only helps it maintain balance, but also allows it to automatically adjust its posture according to changes in the environment. When encountering unilateral or bilateral obstacles, XGO-Rider can quickly identify and respond accordingly, easily crossing obstacles, showing extremely high adaptability.

In order to allow users to give full play to their creativity, XGO-Rider provides an open platform. It supports graphical programming and opens up the underlying serial port protocol and Python interface for users to carry out secondary development. This means that whether students or programming enthusiasts can use these tools to create their own unique applications.

Using XGO-Rider is very simple and intuitive. Just download the XGO mobile app, install it on your Android phone, and turn on the phone's location permission, you can connect to XGO-Rider via Bluetooth for remote control. Whether it is basic command control or complex programming tests, XGO-Rider can handle it easily.

XGO-Rider is not just a robot, it is a window to the future. ELECFREAKS hopes to stimulate children's curiosity, cultivate their creativity and problem-solving skills through this product. Whether for home users or educational institutions, XGO-Rider will be an ideal choice to help children grow through exploration and learn through practice.
