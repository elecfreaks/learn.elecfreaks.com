- Think about how to further optimise the programming to make the XGO Rider perform better.


## Extended Knowledge
Serial communication in the micro:bit V2 is implemented through its on-board ARM Cortex-M0+ microcontroller, which supports serial communication through GPIO (General Purpose Input Output) pins. The following is a detailed description and explanation of the TX (Transmit) and RX (Receive) pins for serial communication in the micro:bit V2:
### TX pin
- **Pin Location**: In micro:bit V2, the TX pin is usually P1. **However, the TX pin is defaulted to P14 for the serial communication between micro:bit and XGO Rider.** **Function**: The TX pin is normally P1 in micro:bit V2 .
- **Function**: The TX pin is used to send data. When the micro:bit needs to send data to another device (such as a computer, another micro:bit, or other device that supports serial communication), it will output data through the TX pin.
- **How it works**: In serial communication, data is sent in serial form, i.e. bit by bit. When sending data, the TX pin generates an electrical signal according to the protocol of serial communication (e.g. RS-232, TTL, etc.).
### RX pin
- **Pin Location**: In micro:bit V2, the RX pin is usually P2. **However, micro:bit and XGO Rider serial communication RX pin defaults to P13. **Function**:  The RX pin is used to  generate an electrical signal according to the  serial communication protocol (e.g. RS-232, TTL, etc . ) .
- **Function**: The RX pin is used to receive data. When an external device sends data to the micro:bit, the data will be input to the micro:bit via the RX pin.
- **How it works**: When receiving data, the RX pin monitors the electrical signals sent by the external device and converts them into digital signals that can later be processed by the micro:bit's microcontroller.
### Configuration and use of serial communications
1. **Initialising the serial port**: When programming, it is usually necessary to initialise the serial port, setting parameters such as baud rate (i.e. the number of bits transmitted per second), data bits, stop bits and parity bits.
2. **SEND DATA**: The TX pin can be programmed to send strings or bytes. 3.
3. **Receiving data**: Similarly, the data received on the RX pin can be read using the programming interface.
### Notes
- **Cross Connection**: When connecting the micro:bit to another device through the serial port, you need to make sure that the TX pin of the micro:bit is connected to the RX pin of the other device and vice versa.
- **Voltage Matching**: The micro:bit's GPIO pins use a 3.3V logic level, so if connecting to another device, you need to make sure the voltages are compatible to avoid damaging the micro:bit.
- **Power Management**: When using serial communications, if the micro:bit is powered by an external power supply, you need to ensure that the supply voltage and current are within safe limits.
Serial communication is a very common way of communicating between electronic devices, and the micro:bit V2 provides this capability through its TX and RX pins, making it possible to exchange simple data with other devices, making it ideal for education, prototyping, and a wide variety of electronic projects.
