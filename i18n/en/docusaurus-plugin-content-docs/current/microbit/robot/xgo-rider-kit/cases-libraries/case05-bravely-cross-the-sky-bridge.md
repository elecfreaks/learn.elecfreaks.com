# Case 05 Bravely cross the sky bridge

## Introduction

In this course, we will lead students to explore the dynamic balance mechanism of bipedal robots in depth and master the principles of the six-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor. Through programming practice, students will learn how to control the opening and closing of the dynamic balance mode of XGO Rider, thereby improving its operational flexibility and stability.



## Teaching objectives

- Understand the principles of the six-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor.
- Learn the programming instructions for opening and closing the dynamic balance mode of XGO Rider.

Please do not place XGO Rider on the edge of the table or in a dangerous place to avoid damage. **

## Teaching process

### Course introduction

With the development of technology, the dynamic balance control of bipedal robots has become increasingly important. In this class, you will learn how the six-axis IMU sensor monitors the robot's posture and programmatically controls the balance mode. This will deepen your understanding of robot kinematics and improve your operating skills. Through practice, you will ensure that XGO Rider operates stably in different environments, whether it is flat or complex terrain.

### Exploration Activities

- How does a bipedal robot maintain its balance?

- How to start or stop the dynamic balance function of XGO Rider through programming?

## Expand knowledge

IMU, or Inertial Measurement Unit, is a device used to measure and report a specific force, angular velocity, and in some cases, the direction of an object around a magnetic field. IMU usually consists of the following main parts:

1. **Accelerometer**: Measures linear acceleration along one or more axes.

2. **Gyroscope**: Measures angular velocity around one or more axes.
3. **Magnetometer**: Measures the direction of the Earth's magnetic field and is used to determine the absolute or relative orientation of an object.

IMU sensors are useful in a variety of applications, including but not limited to:

- **Aerospace**: Used in aircraft navigation systems to help determine the precise position, speed, and orientation of the aircraft.

- **Robotics**: Helps robots understand their position and motion in space, which is especially important for walking robots because they need to maintain balance and navigate.

- **Automotive**: Used in dynamic stability control systems in vehicles, such as anti-lock braking systems (ABS) and electronic stability programs (ESP).

- **Smartphones and wearable devices**: Used for motion detection, direction perception, and user interface interaction.

- **Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)**: Used for head tracking to provide a more natural and immersive user experience.

IMU sensors can provide real-time data, which is critical for systems that require fast responses. However, the data from IMU sensors usually needs to be fused and corrected through complex algorithms to improve the accuracy and reliability of the measurements.
