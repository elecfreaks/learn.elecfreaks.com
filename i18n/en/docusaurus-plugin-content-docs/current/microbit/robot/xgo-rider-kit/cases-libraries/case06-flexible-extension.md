Please do not place the XGO Rider on the edge of the table or in a dangerous place to avoid damage. **

## Teaching process

### Course introduction

In this course, we will study in depth the working principle of the servo and explore how to program the height of the XGO Rider. You will learn to adjust the height of the robot through practice to adapt to various task requirements. This will deepen your understanding of robot kinematics and improve your programming ability to make the XGO Rider movements smoother and more natural.

### Teamwork and Presentation

- Students are divided into groups to jointly understand the motion principle and program the control of XGO Rider.

- Students are encouraged to cooperate, communicate and share experiences with each other.

- Each group has the opportunity to show their programmed XGO Rider to other groups and demonstrate.

**Expected results:**



### Summary and reflection

- Review the course content and remind students what knowledge and skills they have mastered?

- Guide students to discuss the problems and difficulties they encountered during the production process and how to solve these problems.

- Guide students to think and discuss whether there are other mechanical motion structures for bipedal robots.

## Extended knowledge

XGO Rider is equipped with a 4.5KG.CM all-metal magnetic encoding bus serial servo. This high-performance servo motor is widely used in robots, automation equipment and precision control systems.

Brief description of working principle:

- **Motor drive**: A small DC motor receives a control signal and generates a rotational torque.

- **Position feedback**: The magnetic encoder provides accurate position information.

- **Control algorithm**: The built-in microcontroller runs the algorithm to ensure precise control.
- **Communication capability**: Interact with the control system through bus and serial port.
- **Power management**: Internal circuit ensures stable power supply.

Its core features are as follows:

- **High torque**: With 4.5KG.CM torque, it can provide strong rotational force.
- **Durability**: All-metal construction enhances durability and stability.
- **Precise feedback**: The magnetic encoder provides accurate position feedback, which is better than traditional potentiometer encoders.
- **Efficient communication**: Supports bus protocol and simplifies system wiring.
- **Serial port interface**: Data transmission with the control unit through serial communication.

This servo has become the first choice for precision control applications due to its high precision and high reliability.
