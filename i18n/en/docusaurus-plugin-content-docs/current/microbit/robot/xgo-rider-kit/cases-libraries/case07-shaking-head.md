Please do not place the XGO Rider on the edge of the table or in a dangerous place to avoid damage. **

## Teaching process

### Course introduction

In modern robotics, precise posture control is the key to achieving complex movements and maintaining stability. This course will take you to learn how to adjust the left and right tilt angles of its fuselage through programming. You will master sending specific commands to control the robot's posture, and how to obtain and interpret posture angle data, which is essential for the robot to maintain balance on various terrains.

### Exploration activities

## Expand knowledge

In robots, attitude control is a key technology to ensure that the robot can walk and perform actions stably. Roll, Pitch and Yaw are the three basic angles that describe the rotation of robots or any objects in three-dimensional space. They are often used in aerospace, robotics, navigation and virtual reality. Here is a detailed explanation of each term:

1. **Roll**:
- Roll is the rotation of an object around its own X-axis. In bipedal robots, this usually refers to the degree to which the robot's body tilts relative to the horizontal plane. For example, if the robot's upper body tilts to the left or right, its roll angle will change.

2. **Pitch**:
- Pitch is the rotation of an object around its own Y-axis. In bipedal robots, pitch usually describes the forward and backward tilt of the robot's body. If the robot tilts its head forward or leans back, its pitch angle will change.

3. **Yaw**:
- Yaw is the rotation of an object around its own Z-axis. In bipedal robots, yaw describes the left-right rotation of the robot's body. If the robot turns its body left or right, its yaw angle will change accordingly.

Control of these angles is critical to the balance and movement of bipedal robots. By precisely controlling these angles, the robot can adapt to different terrains, avoid falling, and perform complex movements. In practical applications, these angles are typically measured by sensors (such as a six-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU)) and adjusted by control algorithms to ensure the robot's stability and flexibility.
