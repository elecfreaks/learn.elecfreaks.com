# Case 08 Calibration Mode

## Introduction

This course will provide an in-depth explanation of the calibration mode of the bipedal robot XGO Rider, which is a key step to ensure accurate posture control of the robot. Students will learn how to manually adjust the robot's posture and complete the calibration process so that XGO Rider can accurately record and reproduce these postures.



## Teaching Objectives

- Learn and practice the calibration mode of XGO Rider.
- Learn the programming instructions for XGO Rider to enter and complete the calibration mode.

## Teaching Preparation

Before starting the course, please make sure you have prepared the following necessary materials:

Please do not place the XGO Rider on the edge of the table or in a dangerous place to avoid damage. **

## Teaching process

### Course introduction

With use, the XGO Rider may have posture deviations. This course will teach you how to use the **calibration mode** to manually adjust the robot to restore its standard posture. Once the calibration is completed, the XGO Rider will automatically record and maintain this posture to improve the accuracy and stability of the operation. By learning these techniques, you will optimize the performance of the robot. Now, let's learn how to accurately adjust the posture of the XGO Rider.

### Exploration Activities

- How does the XGO Rider posture deviation occur?

- How to enter the calibration mode and complete the calibration?

- How to ensure that the standard posture is manually restored in the calibration mode?

### Start Programming

#### Add the XGO Rider software library

##### 1. Go to "[makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org)" and click **New Project**.

### Summary and Reflection

- Review the course content and remind students what knowledge and skills they have mastered?

- Guide students to discuss the problems and difficulties they encountered during the production process and how to solve these problems.

- Guide students to think and discuss together how to ensure that the manual calibration is in a standard posture?

## Expand knowledge

Tools, also known as fixtures or jigs, are auxiliary tools used to stabilize workpieces for processing, assembly, measurement or inspection. The main types are processing tools, assembly tools, welding tools, inspection tools, and special and general tools. The material and design of the tool are customized according to the specific workpiece requirements to improve production efficiency and ensure product quality.

For the posture calibration of XGO Rider, it is recommended to use a simple jig to quickly and accurately adjust the robot to the standard posture. Such jigs should be designed to be easy to make and use.
