Please do not place the XGO Rider on the edge of the table or in a dangerous place to avoid damage. **

## Teaching process

### Course introduction

Cyclic squatting is a basic action in robot motion control. It can not only improve the stability of the robot, but also enhance its adaptability in complex environments. In this course, you will learn how to use programming instructions to make the XGO Rider perform cyclic squatting, which will help you better understand the robot's motion control logic and more easily command the robot to complete complex actions in actual operation.

### Exploration Activities

- How does the robot perform periodic squatting movements?

- How to control XGO Rider to perform precise periodic squatting movements through programming instructions?

- Is there a more efficient algorithm or method to optimize the robot's squatting movement cycle?

### Summary and reflection

- Guide students to discuss the problems and difficulties they encountered during the production process and how to solve these problems.

- Guide students to think and discuss together how to more effectively ensure the robot's cyclic squat motion.

## Extended knowledge

Cyclic squat motion control involves the robot's dynamic balance and motion coordination. In practical applications, this requires taking into account the robot's center of gravity changes, joint flexibility, and the response speed of the power system. In addition, modern robots often combine sensor feedback, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, to achieve more accurate and stable cyclic squat motion.

When designing the control algorithm for the periodic squat movement, advanced control strategies such as PID controllers are usually used to achieve precise control of the movement cycle. These control strategies can adjust the control input in real time according to the actual movement state of the robot to achieve the predetermined movement goal. At the same time, through machine learning and artificial intelligence technology, the robot's periodic squat movement can also be adaptive and optimized to adapt to different environments and task requirements.
