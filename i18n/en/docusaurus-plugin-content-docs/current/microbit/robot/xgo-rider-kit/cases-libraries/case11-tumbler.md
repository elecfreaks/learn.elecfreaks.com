Please do not place the XGO Rider on the edge of the table or in a dangerous place to avoid damage. **

## Teaching process

### Course introduction

Periodic motion is an important element in the dynamic performance of robots. It not only increases the fun of robots, but also provides an effective way of interaction in certain application scenarios. In this course, you will learn how to program the XGO Rider to shake left and right periodically, which will help you understand the role of time period in motion control and how to achieve precise motion control through programming.

### Exploration Activities

- How does the robot achieve periodic left and right shaking?
- How to control the shaking period of XGO Rider through programming instructions?
- Can the smoothness and effect of shaking be optimized by adjusting parameters?

### Start Programming

#### Add XGO Rider Software Library

##### 1. Go to "[makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org)" and click **New Project**.

- Guide students to discuss the problems and difficulties they encountered during the production process and how to solve these problems.

- Guide students to think and discuss together how to achieve periodic motion control more effectively.

## Expand knowledge

Periodic motion control is an important aspect of robot dynamic behavior design, which involves precise time and space control of robot motion. In practical applications, this usually requires consideration of the robot's dynamic characteristics, sensor feedback, and environmental factors. By learning the control of periodic motion, students can not only improve their programming skills, but also deepen their understanding of robot kinematics and control theory. In addition, modern robotics technology often combines advanced algorithms, such as PID control, to achieve more stable and precise motion control.
