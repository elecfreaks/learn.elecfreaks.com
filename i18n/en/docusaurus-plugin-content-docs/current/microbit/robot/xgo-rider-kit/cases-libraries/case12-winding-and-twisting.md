Please do not place the XGO Rider on the edge of the table or in a dangerous place to avoid damage. **

  ## Teaching process

  ### Course introduction

  Z-shaped forward movement is a common robot path planning action, which requires the robot to flexibly change direction during the forward movement to adapt to different environments and task requirements. In this course, we will guide students to learn how to program the XGO Rider to perform a Z-shaped forward movement, which will help students better understand the robot's motion control and path planning.

  ### Exploration Activities

- Guide students to think and discuss together how to optimize the Z-shaped forward movement of XGO Rider.

## Extended knowledge

The kinematic principle of the Z-shaped forward movement involves the robot's steering mechanism and path planning algorithm. In practical applications, this usually requires the robot to be able to perceive the surrounding environment and adjust its motion trajectory in real time. Sensors, such as ultrasonic sensors, infrared sensors or cameras, can provide the necessary environmental information to help the robot avoid obstacles and plan the best path.

When programming to achieve zigzag movement, a variety of algorithms can be used, such as the A* search algorithm, the Dijkstra algorithm, or the behavior-based path planning method. These algorithms can calculate an optimal or feasible path based on the robot's current position, target position, and environmental information.

In addition, zigzag movement can also be achieved by controlling the speed difference between the left and right wheels of the robot. This method requires precise control of the speed and direction of the motor to ensure that the robot can perform zigzag movements smoothly.

Through the study of this course, students can not only master the programming skills of zigzag movement, but also have a deep understanding of the basic principles of robot motion control and path planning, laying a solid foundation for more complex robot applications in the future.
