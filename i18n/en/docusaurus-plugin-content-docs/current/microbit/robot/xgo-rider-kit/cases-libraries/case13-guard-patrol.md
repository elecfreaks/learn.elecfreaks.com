# Case 13: Guard Patrol

## Introduction

In this course, students will learn how to program XGO Rider to perform a reciprocating motion similar to a guard. This motion pattern is essential for understanding the path repetition and task automation of the robot. Students will master the programming skills of loop control and conditional judgment through practical operations, thereby improving their application capabilities in the fields of automation and robot programming.



## Teaching Objectives

- Master the programming concepts of loop control and conditional judgment.

- Learn the programming method to achieve the periodic reciprocating motion of XGO Rider.
- Enhance students' understanding of robot task automation.

Please do not place XGO Rider on the edge of the table or in a dangerous place to avoid damage. **

## Teaching process

### Course introduction

The guard's patrol back and forth is a typical example of an automated task. In this course, students will learn how to program XGO Rider to simulate this behavior, which can not only deepen students' understanding of robot motion control, but also exercise their ability to realize automated tasks.

### Exploration activities

- How can robots perform repetitive tasks without external instructions?
- How to implement XGO Rider's back-and-forth motion through programming?
- What strategies can be used to optimize the robot's patrol path?

### Start Programming

#### Add XGO Rider Software Library

##### 1. Go to "[makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org)" and click **New Project**.
