## Teaching process

### Introduction

We have developed XGO APP for XGO Rider to control the movement of XGO Rider. You can control the movement of the XGO Rider with your fingers to feel the movement of the XGO Rider.

This tutorial will take you from downloading the XGO APP, to the final skill of controlling the XGO Rider through the XGO APP to achieve the desired movement effect, so let's get started.
