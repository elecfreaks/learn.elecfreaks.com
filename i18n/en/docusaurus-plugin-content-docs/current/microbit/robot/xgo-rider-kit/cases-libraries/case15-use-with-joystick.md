# Case15 Use with Joystick

## Introduction

In this course, we will introduce how to use the Joystick:bit V2 remote control to remotely control the XGO Rider. Students will learn how to program the micro:bit wireless group and how to program the Joystick:bit V2. By combining these two innovative devices, you will be able to experience more fun and interactive ways to bring more functionality and action to the XGO Rider.



## Teaching Objectives

- Learn how to use and program the Joystick V2 remote control.
- Learn how to program the Joystick V2 to communicate with the XGO Rider.



## Preparation

Before starting the lesson, please make sure you have prepared the following necessary materials:

## Teaching Process

### Introduction

Both Joystick:bit V2 and XGO Rider use micro:bit as the main controller, and it is possible to communicate between the two main controllers based on the Bluetooth function of micro:bit V2. Therefore, this tutorial will program both devices using a graphical programming platform: MakeCode. Whether you are a beginner or a professional, with this tutorial you will be able to easily master the remote control of the XGO Rider and bring more creativity and inspiration to your research, teaching or entertainment projects. Let's get started!



### Exploration Activities

- How is Joysticks V2 programmed?
- How does Joysticks V2 communicate with the XGO Rider?



### Start Programming

#### Add the XGO Rider and Joysticksbit libraries.

##### 1. Go to “[makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org)” and click **New Project**.
