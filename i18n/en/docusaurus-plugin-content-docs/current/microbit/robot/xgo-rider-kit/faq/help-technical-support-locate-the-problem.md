# Help Technical Support Locate the Problem

Dear user, thank you for choosing our product~

Since we need to consider many possibilities to understand what exactly happened to your product, the more information you provide, the better we can understand the situation, and the faster we can provide suggestions and solve the problem.

This article lists some key information that can help us solve the problem. When you email Technical Support at support@elecfreaks.com, please include the following information. Thank you!

## 1. Product failure video

Take a video of the product problem. If you missed it, see if you can reproduce the problem, then take a video and send it to us. This way, we can see the same thing you see and eliminate any ambiguity or information loss during the communication process. A good video is more accurate than describing the problem in a thousand words.
