## Purpose

Hello, in this class we are about to learn to program and control XGO, we will make XGO do more interesting things and make it our best friend. In this lesson, we programmed XGO to move forward quickly. Of course, if you want XGO to turn and adjust the code, let's start.

Follow the prompts and shake your phone, the Bluetooth will connect automatically. (Note: Make sure to power on the XGO in advance, and turn on the phone's Bluetooth and location services beforehand. If you cannot connect, check your phone settings to ensure that the XGO app has been granted location and Bluetooth permissions.) The result of a successful connection will be as shown in the figure.

## Control

Tap on the arrow indication on the main page to enter the control page. The XGO app offers two ways to control the XGO: **MOTION** and **ARM**. For our first-generation XGO, only the **MOTION** function is needed.
