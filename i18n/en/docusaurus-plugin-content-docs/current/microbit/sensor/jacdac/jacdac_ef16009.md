# Jacdac UVI Sensor

It focuses on detecting the intensity of ultraviolet radiation and outputs the corresponding UVI value. In outdoor sports equipment, it reminds users of the harm of ultraviolet rays and prompts them to apply sunscreen in a timely manner; in meteorological monitoring stations, it provides the public with a reference for outdoor ultraviolet intensity to help them arrange travel activities reasonably.
