            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
        }}
    />
</div>


### Result
 Preheat it for 10 minutes after connections, detect the smoke by approaching the probes to the smoke while the returned value is almost stable.
 With the change of the smoke, the returned value gets bigger with the growing of the smoke concentration.
