# Case 04: Farmlands Protection Device


##  Introduction
---

- In order to protect the farmlands from people to get in, we can set a farmland protection device.

##  Function
---
- Detect if there is any people approaching with the PIR sensor and Sonar:bit,  if yes, program to remind people of not coming by lighting on the rainbow LED.

## Hardware Connection
---

Connect the Sonar:bit to P1, the PIR sensor to P2 and the rainbow LED to P9 on IoT:bit.

For programming, we need to add a package: click "Extensions" at the bottom of the MakeCode drawer and search with "iot-environment-kit" in the dialogue box to download it.

## Program

---

Drag the on start block from the drawer, initialize the strip connecting to P9 with 1 led.

Set to connect the sonar:bit to P1 with unit "cm" and the PIR sensor to P2, save the returned values as the variable "ultrasonic_distance" and the variable "IR" accordingly.

Judge if the variable "ultrasonic_distance" is in the threshold, if yes, judge if the variable "IR" is 1, if yes, set the strip to show red and the buzzer to alarm; or turn the lights off.

If the variable "ultrasonic_distance" is not in the threshold, program to turn off it light.

## Result
---
- If the device detects any people coming to the farmlands, the red light turns on and the buzzer alarms.
