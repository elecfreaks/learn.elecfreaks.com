This is a waterproof design wind speed sensor that uses the standard connector of Octopus related products for easy connection with other devices. It is able to provide corresponding voltage output according to the change of wind speed. As the wind speed increases, the output voltage also increases, providing users with accurate wind speed measurement. This wind speed sensor can be applied in meteorological observation and environmental monitoring, and can be used to measure wind speed. Its waterproof design ensures reliability and durability in harsh environments.

A dust sensor is an air quality sensor used to detect the concentration of fine dust particles in the air.

It uses the principle of infrared light scattering to measure the concentration of particulate matter. The sensor contains an infrared light source and a photosensitive element inside. When airborne particles pass through the sensor, they scatter infrared light and the photosensitive element measures the intensity of the scattered light. Based on the intensity of the scattered light, the sensor can estimate the concentration of airborne particles.

The dust sensor is characterised by high sensitivity and fast response. It detects particles with diameters between 0.5 and 2.5 micrometres, which are usually the most dangerous fine dust particles in the air, such as bacteria, pollen and smoke. The voltage signal output from the sensor is proportional to the concentration of the particulate matter.

This type of sensor is usually used in air purifiers, air quality monitoring equipment and industrial environmental monitoring. It can help people understand the quality of the air around them and take appropriate measures to improve the air quality.
