# Introduction

Smart Climate Kit is an innovative product designed based on micro:bit V2 and IOT:bit expansion board. Equipped with a variety of sensors such as wind speed sensor, temperature and humidity sensor, UV sensor, dust sensor and OLED display, it is able to monitor and record a variety of environmental data in real time, and upload the data to the cloud. The goal of the kit is to combine meteorological science and IoT technology to stimulate children's curiosity about natural phenomena and develop their scientific thinking and data analysis skills. Children can explore the mysteries of meteorology and understand the impact of weather changes on our daily lives through hands-on and real-time monitoring. This will not only help their learning and interest development, but also cultivate their innovative thinking and scientific literacy, laying a solid foundation for their future in the field of science and technology.

Explore the mysteries of climate, cultivate scientific thinking, and start the STEAM journey.
