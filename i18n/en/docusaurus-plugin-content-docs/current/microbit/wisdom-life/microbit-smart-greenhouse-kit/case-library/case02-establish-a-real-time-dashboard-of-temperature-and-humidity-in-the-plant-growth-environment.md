## Teaching process

### Course introduction

In the last course, we used the smart greenhouse to obtain the temperature data and soil moisture data of the plant growth environment and displayed them on the micro:bit LED display, but this method cannot view the historical data of temperature and humidity or real-time viewing. In this course, we will use the WiFi function of IOT:bit to upload the temperature and humidity data to the IOT cloud data platform ThingSpeak, so that we can intuitively see the changing trends and historical data of the temperature and humidity of the plant growth environment.

Now, let's get started!

### Exploration activities

- How to correctly establish the ThingSpeak platform data dashboard?

- How to program the use of the WiFi function of IOT:bit?

### ThingSpeak platform to establish a data dashboard

For the use of the ThingSpeak platform and the establishment of a dashboard, please refer to this article: [how-to-use-thinkspeak](https://wiki.elecfreaks.com/en/microbit/wisdom-life/microbit-smart-science-iot-kit/how-to-use-thinkspeak/).

Refer to the following figure:

### Assemble the smart greenhouse kit

Insert the micro:bit into the IOT:bit expansion board, apply traceless glue on the back of the IOT:bit expansion board, and fix it to the base of the greenhouse model, as shown below:

Fix the 8 rainbow light rings to the top of the transparent cover.![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/docs/microbit/wisdom-life/microbit-smart-greenhouse-kit/images/microbit-greenhouse-hardware-introduction-021.png)Use traceless glue to stick the light sensor to the top of the transparent cover of the greenhouse model, as shown in the figure below.

![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/docs/microbit/wisdom-life/microbit-smart-greenhouse-kit/images/microbit-greenhouse-hardware-introduction-022.png)

Pass the connection wires of the soil moisture sensor, the connection wires of the 8 rainbow light rings, the connection wires of the light sensor, and the 3V water pump hose through the holes of the transparent outer cover of the greenhouse as shown in the figure below, and then lower it:

![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/docs/microbit/wisdom-life/microbit-smart-greenhouse-kit/images/microbit-greenhouse-hardware-introduction-023.png)

Connect the 3V water pump, 3V relay, soil moisture sensor, light sensor and 8 rainbow LED to the IOT:bit expansion board as shown in the following wiring diagram.

|      Component       | IOT:bit corresponding pin |
| :------------------: | :-----------------------: |
|    8 rainbow LED     |            P1             |
| soil moisture sensor |            P2             |
|     light sensor     |            P3             |

## Expand knowledge

**Introduction to the ThingSpeak platform**: ThingSpeak is a free Internet platform for collecting, analyzing and visualizing real-time data. It allows users to create their own data streams and upload data in various ways, including sensors, devices or other sources. ThingSpeak provides a range of tools for real-time monitoring and analysis of data, and can be integrated with other applications and devices. Users can create their own dashboards and charts to visualize data, and can access data through APIs for customized data analysis and processing. ThingSpeak also supports data storage and sharing, making it easy for users to share their data with others. In short, ThingSpeak is a powerful platform that helps users collect, analyze and share real-time data.
