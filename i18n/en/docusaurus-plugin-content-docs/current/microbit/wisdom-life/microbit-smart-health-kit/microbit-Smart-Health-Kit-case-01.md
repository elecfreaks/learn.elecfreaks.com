# Case 01: Touch-free Hands Washing Device


##  Introduction
---

- Maintaining clean and hygienic hands can prevent diseases from entering the mouth, thereby reducing the risk of intestinal infectious diseases such as diarrhea and respiratory infectious diseases such as pneumonia. After washing our hands, we need to close the water valve, which will cause pollution to our hands, thus, we can make a touch-free hand washing device.

## Function
---

- Detect if there is anyone approaching with the PIR sensor, if yes, program to open the water valve.

## Program
---
Judge the detected motion of  variable "IR", if yes, set to show "√" and the servo to drive to 0° to open the water valve; or set to show "x" and to drive to 180° to close the water valve.
