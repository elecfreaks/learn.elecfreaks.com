# Case 11: Smart Trash Can


##  Introduction
---

- If the trash can has no lid, it is easy to emit peculiar smell and affect the surrounding environment, but if the lid is closed and requires to be opened manually, it is easy to cause secondary pollution. Thus, we can design a smart trash can that automatically opens the lid when someone approaches.

## Function
---

- Detect if there are humans approaching with the PIR sensor, program to open the lid automatically when people come.

## Hardware Connection
---

Connect the PIR sensor to P1 and the servo to P2 on sensor:bit.

## Program

---
Judge the value of the variable "IR", if yes, program to display a "√" and set the servo to drive to 0° to open the lid of the trash can; or to display a "×" and set the servo to drive to 180° to close the lid.
