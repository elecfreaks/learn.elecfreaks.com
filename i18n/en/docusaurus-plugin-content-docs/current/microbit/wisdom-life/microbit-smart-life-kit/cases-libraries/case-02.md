# Water Level Detection Device

## Introduction

In this project, we will learn how to make a water level detection device, which uses a water level sensor to monitor water level changes in real time and converts these data into the rotation angle of the servo to intuitively reflect the current water level.

Agricultural irrigation: In the agricultural field, water level monitoring devices can ensure that farmland is properly irrigated, improve irrigation efficiency, reduce water waste, and contribute to the healthy growth of crops.

Environmental monitoring: Water level monitoring devices play an important role in monitoring environmental changes, such as the impact of climate change on water levels, water pollution, etc. They can provide important data on the health of water bodies and help environmental protection and ecological research.

Industrial applications: In the industrial field, water level monitoring devices are used to monitor the liquid water level in industrial processes to ensure the safety and efficiency of production processes, such as chemical, petroleum and water treatment plants.

Flood control and disaster warning: Water level monitoring devices can monitor water level changes in real time, provide data for flood warning systems, and help relevant departments take timely measures to reduce the impact of natural disasters such as floods.

Urban drainage systems: In urban infrastructure, water level monitoring devices can monitor the water level of drainage pipes, promptly detect and deal with problems such as poor drainage, and ensure the normal operation of urban drainage systems.

Hydropower station and dam safety: Water level monitoring devices are essential for the operation management of hydropower stations and the safety monitoring of dams. They can monitor the water level changes in reservoirs and ensure the power generation efficiency of hydropower stations and the safety of dam structures.

Scientific research and education: In the field of scientific research and education, water level monitoring devices can be used as research tools to help students and researchers better understand knowledge in fields such as hydrology, environmental science and ecology.

In summary, water level monitoring devices are widely used. They not only help improve the utilization efficiency of water resources, but also play an important role in environmental protection, disaster prevention and industrial production. With the development of technology, the accuracy and reliability of water level monitoring devices will be further improved, providing stronger support for the sustainable management and protection of water resources.
