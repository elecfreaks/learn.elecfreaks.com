# Smart Washbasin

## Introduction

In this project, we will learn how to make a smart washbasin that uses ultrasonic sensors to accurately detect human approach. Once a person is detected, the system automatically triggers the water pump to achieve automatic water discharge without manual operation, which is both hygienic and convenient.

## Course Introduction

Since 2019, the new coronavirus epidemic has ravaged the world, causing great impact on people's production and life. Regarding preventing virus infection, we must maintain social distance, wash hands frequently and maintain hygiene, etc. We found that there are some differences between the washbasins in public places and those at home. Many faucets in public places do not need to be touched by hand, which greatly reduces the risk of cross-infection. How is it achieved? Can we make one ourselves?

## Project Production

### Result

After turning on the power, the OLED displays the current water level value, and the current water level is more intuitively reflected through the rotation angle of the servo.

**For demonstration purposes, materials not included in the set were used in the result display, such as wooden houses, water cups, etc.**
