# Fire Alarm Device

## Introduction

In this project, we will learn how to make a fire alarm device, using the MQ2 smoke sensor to detect smoke. When smoke is detected, it will automatically sound an alarm and spray water to extinguish the fire.

## Course Introduction

The purpose of installing an automatic fire alarm system is to detect fires in time, take measures such as fire extinguishing and evacuation in time, and minimize the losses caused by fire. What functions should a fire alarm device include? Can we make a fire alarm device?

You can also download the program directly from the following web page.

<div
    style={{
        position: 'relative',
        paddingBottom: '60%',
        overflow: 'hidden',
    }}
>
    <iframe

        }}
    />
</div>




### How to download the program to micro:bit?

Use a USB cable to connect PC and micro:bit V2.

![](https://wiki-media-ef.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/docs/microbit/interesting-case/microbit-smart-climate-kit/cases-libraries/images/connect-microbit.gif)

After the connection is successful, a drive named `MICROBIT` will be recognized on the computer.

### Result

When the fire alarm device detects smoke or is manually triggered, it will automatically spray water and sound an alarm.

## Extended knowledge

**What functions should the automatic fire alarm system include? **

1. Trigger device

In the automatic fire alarm system, the device that automatically or manually generates a fire alarm signal is called a trigger device.
• Mainly includes fire detectors and manual fire alarm buttons.
• Fire detectors are devices that can respond to fire parameters (such as smoke, temperature, flame radiation, gas concentration, etc.) and automatically generate fire alarm signals.
• Manual fire alarm buttons are devices that manually generate fire alarm signals and start the automatic fire alarm system.

2. Fire alarm device

• In the automatic fire alarm system, the control indicating device used to receive, display and transmit fire alarm signals, and can send control signals and have other auxiliary functions is called a fire alarm device.
• The fire alarm controller is responsible for providing a stable working power supply for the fire detector; monitoring the working status of the detector and the system itself.
• Receive, convert and process the alarm signal output by the fire detector.

3. Linkage output device

• A device that sends out fire alarm signals that are different from ambient sound and light is called a fire alarm device.
• It sends out fire alarm signals to the alarm area in the form of sound, light and audio to warn people to quickly take safe evacuation measures and take fire-fighting and disaster relief measures.
