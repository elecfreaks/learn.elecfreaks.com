## Expand knowledge

**Advantages of Smart Trash Cans**
As an emerging household product, smart trash cans have many significant advantages over traditional trash cans:

Automatic sensor lid opening: Smart trash cans are usually equipped with infrared sensors. When a person's hand or object approaches, the lid will automatically open, avoiding manual contact and making it more hygienic and convenient.

Automatic packaging and bag changing: Some smart trash cans have the function of automatically packing garbage bags, making it convenient for users to change garbage bags and keep the trash can clean.

Classification tips and education: Smart trash cans can guide users to correctly classify garbage through voice or screen prompts, helping to improve the public's environmental awareness and garbage classification knowledge.

Data collection and analysis: Some smart trash cans can collect usage data to help managers understand the type and quantity of garbage and optimize the garbage disposal process.

Energy saving and environmental protection: The design of smart trash cans focuses on energy saving. They are usually battery-powered, have low power consumption, and have good sealing performance, reducing odor and mosquito problems.

Improve efficiency: The automatic lid opening function of smart trash cans can speed up garbage placement and improve the cleaning efficiency of public areas.

Beautiful design: Smart trash cans tend to be more modern and beautiful in appearance design, and can be integrated into different homes or public environments.

Reduce odor: Smart trash cans usually have good sealing properties, which can prevent the odor of garbage from dispersing and keep the environment fresh.

Intelligent sterilization: Some high-end smart trash cans have sterilization functions, which can reduce the growth of bacteria and protect users’ health.

Community publicity: Smart trash cans can also be used as community publicity tools to carry out environmental protection publicity and information notifications through voice broadcasts and other methods.

These advantages of smart trash cans make them an important tool to improve the quality of life and promote environmental protection. However, they also have some disadvantages, such as the need for regular battery replacement, high adaptability to the environment, and possible cost issues. However, with the advancement of technology and reduction of costs, these shortcomings are gradually being overcome.
