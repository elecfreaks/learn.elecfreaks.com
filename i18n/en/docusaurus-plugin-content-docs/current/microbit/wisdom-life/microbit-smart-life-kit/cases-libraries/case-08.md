# Smart medicine box

## Introduction

In this project, we will learn how to make a smart medicine box. You can control the medicine box to dispense medicine by pressing the collision sensor, display the number of times to take medicine through the OLED display, and use the light sensor to detect the ambient light intensity around the medicine box. When the ambient light intensity exceeds the threshold, an alarm will automatically sound to remind the user not to store medicine in a strong light environment.

### Results

The smart medicine box can be controlled to dispense medicine by pressing the collision sensor, the number of times the medicine is taken is displayed on the OLED display, and the light sensor is used to detect the ambient light intensity around the medicine box. When the ambient light intensity exceeds the threshold, an alarm is automatically issued to remind the user not to store the medicine in a strong light environment.

**For demonstration purposes, materials not included in the set were used in the result display, such as wooden houses, water cups, etc.**
