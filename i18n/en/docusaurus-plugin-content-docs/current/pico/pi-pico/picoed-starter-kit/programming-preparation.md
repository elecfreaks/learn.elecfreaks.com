# Programming Environment Preparation

## Setting Up the Programming Environment

1. We need to write programs in programming software, so first, we should download and install a programming tool. The software we recommend is: [Thonny](https://thonny.org/).

2. Install Thonny, select the language option as needed, and use the standard settings (set to "Standard").

3. After connecting the development board to the computer via USB, select the `Tools→Options` command from the main menu. In the panel below, select the board type: MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico), then click to choose to install or update the firmware.

<!--## Connecting Pico to the Computer

Press and hold the BOOTSEL button, then plug Pico into the USB port of a Raspberry Pi or another computer. After connecting Pico, release the BOOTSEL button. This will make the computer recognize Pico as a mass storage device named RPI-RP2.
