# RETRO ARCADE
---

ELECFREAKS Retro Makecode Arcade For Education is the first arcade device on a big screen with a high resolution. Kids are able to use them to create their games in a fun and easy way through the blocks program, and the Retro allows for a self-defined game role, multiple game sceneries, and plot design. It surprises you more with the bountiful built-in sensors and gives kids more chances for creation.
